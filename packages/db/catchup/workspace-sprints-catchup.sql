-- Collapses per team sprints into one series per workspace.
--
-- A sprint used to belong to a team: cycle.team_id was not null and the number was unique
-- per team, so every team had its own Sprint 1 running at the same time. A sprint now
-- belongs to the workspace and holds work from any team or project, so the number has to be
-- unique per organization instead, and two open sprints may no longer overlap.
--
-- What it does, in order:
--   1. Groups the open sprints of each workspace into runs that overlap in time. A run is a
--      chain of sprints where each one starts before the previous one has ended.
--   2. Merges each run into the sprint in it holding the most work, moving the issues of the
--      others onto it. Sprints in different runs are left where they are, so a sprint
--      planned for next month stays next month rather than being pulled into this one.
--   3. Archives the sprints emptied by that merge.
--   4. Renumbers what is left, oldest first, into one sequence per organization.
--   5. Makes team_id nullable, points its foreign key at set null rather than cascade, clears
--      it on the sprints that are still open, and swaps the unique index onto
--      (organization_id, number).
--
-- Sprints that already finished keep their team_id, so past sprints still read as the team
-- that ran them. Sprints that are still open carry no team from here on.
--
-- No issue is deleted or detached: every issue either stays where it is or moves onto the
-- sprint its own run was merged into.
--
-- Safe to run more than once. Every step checks first and the whole thing is one
-- transaction, so a failure leaves the database exactly as it was.
--
-- Apply it with
--   psql "$DATABASE_URL" -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 -f packages/db/catchup/workspace-sprints-catchup.sql
-- using the direct connection on port 5432, not the pooler on 6543.
