# Tack

Free, realtime, keyboard-first task manager. The UX polish of the best paid task managers with the breadth of the open-source ones, plus docs, files, notifications, GitHub, and an MCP server. No pricing, no billing, no paid tiers anywhere.

## Hard rules

1. **Bun is the package manager and the script runner.** There is no pnpm, no npm, no yarn, no Turbo, and no `node_modules` produced by anything but `bun install`. Every command in this file starts with `bun`. The deployed runtime is node, so shipped code must not import a Bun built-in.
2. **No comments in code.** Ever. `bun run check-comments` fails the build on any comment that is not a functional directive (`@ts-*`, `biome-ignore`, `eslint-*`, `/*! license */`). Make names and structure carry meaning.
3. **No AI attribution.** Never mention Claude, Anthropic, Codex, or AI tooling in commits, branches, PRs, code, or docs.
4. **No em-dash characters** in code, copy, docs, or commit messages. Use commas, colons, or separate sentences.
5. **Strict types only.** `any` is a lint error. Non-null assertions are a lint error. `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` and `exactOptionalPropertyTypes` are on. Validate every external input with Zod.
6. **Every check green before you finish.** `bun run verify` runs lint, comment policy, typecheck, and tests.

## Bun is the toolchain, not the runtime

Bun installs, runs scripts, and runs tests. Shipped server code must not call a
Bun built-in, because the web app runs on Vercel's node runtime: that is the only
runtime where a Vercel function can upgrade a websocket, and `/api/ws` needs it.
Anything imported from `bun` fails there with `Cannot find module 'bun'`.

| Need | Use | Never use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Postgres | `postgres.js` through `drizzle-orm/postgres-js` | `Bun.SQL`, `drizzle-orm/bun-sql`, `pg` |
| Redis and pub/sub | `ioredis` | `Bun.RedisClient`, `node-redis` |
| Object storage | `@aws-sdk/client-s3` and `@aws-sdk/s3-request-presigner` | `Bun.S3Client` |
| Reading and writing files | `node:fs/promises` | `Bun.file()`, `Bun.write()` |
| Hashing passwords | `@node-rs/argon2` (argon2id) | `Bun.password`, `bcrypt` |
| Sortable ids | `randomUUIDv7()` from `@tack/shared/utils` | `Bun.randomUUIDv7()`, `ulid`, `nanoid` |
| WebSocket server | `ws`, upgraded by `@vercel/functions` | `Bun.serve({ websocket })` in shipped code |
| Running TypeScript | `bun file.ts` | `tsx`, `ts-node` |
| Tests | `bun test` | `vitest`, `jest` |
| Subprocesses | `Bun.spawn`, `Bun.$` | `node:child_process` |
| Workspace script running | `bun run --filter '<pattern>' <script>` | `turbo`, `nx`, `lerna` |
| Env files | `bun --env-file=...` | `dotenv` |

Test files and `apps/realtime` may use Bun built-ins, because both only ever run
under Bun. `packages/realtime-server` is imported by the web app, so it may not.

`bun run check-bun-imports` enforces that, and `bun run verify` runs it. It fails
on a value import, a bare import, a `require` or a dynamic `import()` of `bun` or
`bun:*` from anything the web app ships. A type-only import is allowed, because
it is erased before it reaches the runtime: `packages/realtime-server/src/socket.ts`
takes `ServerWebSocket` that way so `fromBunSocket` can adapt the development
server's socket without the node build ever resolving `bun`. Dev runs Next under
Bun and production runs it under node, so nothing else catches this before deploy.

Bun does not implement `process.loadEnvFile`. Load the repository `.env` with `bun --env-file=../../.env` in the script, never from inside a config file.

Bun does not load a parent directory `.env`, so a script running with its cwd inside a workspace package needs `--env-file=../../.env` to see the repository environment.

## Layout

```
apps/web                  Next.js 16 app: UI, REST route handlers, auth, webhooks,
                          the realtime socket at /api/ws and the MCP server at /mcp
apps/realtime             Bun.serve WebSocket host, local development only, never deployed
packages/realtime-server  Connection hub: tickets, scopes, presence, Redis fan-out
packages/mcp-server       MCP tools and the fetch handler behind /mcp
packages/db               Drizzle schema, migrations, client, seed
packages/shared           Zod validators, domain types, event contracts, pure utils
scripts/                  repo tooling, written in TypeScript and run with bun
extras/                   working notes, task board, demo artifacts (not shipped)
```

Everything ships as one Next.js app on a single Vercel project. The realtime hub
and the MCP tools live in packages so the app stays thin and both keep their own
test suites. `apps/realtime` exists only so local development has a socket server,
because a Vercel function cannot upgrade a connection under `next dev`.

Cross-app code lives in `packages/shared`. If two apps need it, it belongs there, never duplicated.

## Commands

```
bun install          install every workspace dependency
bun run infra:up     start postgres, redis, minio
bun run db:push      apply schema to the dev database
bun run db:seed      load demo org, teams, members, issues, comments
bun run db:test-setup create the per package test databases and push the schema
bun run dev          run web, realtime, and mcp together
bun run verify       lint + comment policy + typecheck + tests
bun test             run one package's tests from inside that package
```

Ports: web 3000, realtime 3100, postgres 5434, redis 6380, minio 9010. The realtime
port is development only. In production the socket is always served from the web app
at `/api/ws` on the page's own origin: `configuredRealtimeUrl()` ignores
`NEXT_PUBLIC_REALTIME_URL` whenever `NODE_ENV` is `production`, so the variable is a
local development override and nothing else. Never set it on a deployed environment.
A deployed value is ignored and only obscures the intended production topology.

Email goes out through Resend only. Set `RESEND_API_KEY` and an `EMAIL_FROM` on a
domain verified in Resend, otherwise every send fails.

## Conventions

- **Naming.** Files kebab-case. React components PascalCase. Hooks `use-*.ts`. Zod schemas `xSchema`, inferred types `X`. Database tables singular snake_case.
- **Imports.** Use workspace aliases `@tack/db`, `@tack/shared`. Inside `apps/web` use `@/`.
- **Validation.** Every route handler parses input with a Zod schema from `@tack/shared`. Never trust a request body.
- **Errors.** Throw typed domain errors from `@tack/shared/errors`. Route handlers map them to responses. Never swallow an error silently.
- **Server state.** TanStack Query for fetching, with optimistic mutations. The realtime stream invalidates and patches the cache; it never triggers a full refetch of a list the user is looking at.
- **Realtime.** Every mutation writes to Postgres, bumps `sync_id`, and publishes a `SyncAction` to Redis. The realtime server fans it out to subscribed clients. Contract lives in `packages/shared/src/events`.
  A scope decides who is delivered a row, so it has to match who may read it: a project and its milestones
  carry the scopes of the teams that own them and fall back to the workspace scope only when the project
  belongs to no team, and a private saved view carries its owner alone.
- **Socket lifetime.** A socket never outlives its session. Signing out publishes a session revocation on
  the control channel and the hub closes that connection, and the hub also sweeps the sessions behind every
  open connection on an interval, so an expired or deleted session is dropped even when nothing announced it.
- **Auth.** better-auth. Passkeys, Google, GitHub, email OTP. Email and password is
  optional, off unless `TACK_PASSWORD_AUTH=true`, hashed with `@node-rs/argon2` (argon2id),
  rate limited, and never a replacement for the passwordless methods.
- **MCP auth.** OAuth only, no API keys. The web app hosts the OAuth server through the better-auth
  `mcp` plugin: discovery under `/.well-known/oauth-*`, dynamic client registration, PKCE, and a
  consent screen at `/oauth/authorize` where the user picks a workspace and re-verifies a passkey. The
  standalone MCP server validates the access token against the shared database (`verifyMcpAccessToken`)
  and returns a `WWW-Authenticate` challenge on `401`. A `mcp_grant` row binds a client and user to the
  chosen workspace. The granted scopes decide the tool set: a read tool needs `tack.read`, a write tool
  needs `tack.write`, and a token carrying neither is refused with a `403` before any tool is registered.
- **Email domains.** `ALLOWED_EMAIL_DOMAINS` is a comma-separated allowlist enforced on invite
  creation and on user creation, so it covers every provider. Empty means no restriction. A
  workspace can narrow it further with its own `allowedEmailDomains`.
- **Permissions.** All authorization goes through `packages/shared/src/policy`. Server routes enforce it. The UI reads the same policy to hide affordances, never as the only gate.
- **Motion.** No layout animation on the critical path, ever: nothing that triggers reflow may animate. Entrance, exit and gesture motion is transform and opacity only. Hover and focus state changes may additionally transition colour, which is what the task managers we measured against do, but only through the shared tokens in `apps/web/src/lib/interaction.ts` so the set stays auditable, never hand-rolled at a call site. Micro-interactions such as row and item highlights may go as fast as 80ms; nothing exceeds 200ms; everything respects `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- **Theming.** Light and dark both first class, driven by CSS custom properties and `next-themes`. Never hardcode a hex value in a component.
- **Accessibility.** Keyboard operable everywhere, visible focus rings, real semantics from Radix primitives.
- **Single instance dependencies.** A library whose types or runtime identity cross package boundaries,
  CodeMirror above all, must resolve to exactly one version. Bun keeps a transitive resolution that still
  satisfies its range, so bumping only the direct dependency leaves the old copy nested under every other
  package that wanted it. Two copies of `@codemirror/view` fail typecheck under `exactOptionalPropertyTypes`
  the moment a value crosses between them, and a facet or instance compared across the two copies is a
  runtime bug waiting for the next refactor to expose it. The `overrides` block
  in the root `package.json` is what collapses them, and `bun run check-deps` fails the build when an
  overridden package resolves twice or when a bump left in a manifest is one the override silently swallows.
  An override shadows a direct dependency too, so a real version move means editing both the manifest range
  and the override, then running `bun install`.

## Testing

- Unit and integration: `bun test`. Tests live in each package's own `tests/` tree, mirroring the
  layout of `src/`, never beside the code. `src/a/b/thing.ts` is tested by `tests/a/b/thing.test.ts`.
  Bun's scanner skips directories whose name starts with a dot, so a test for something under
  `src/app/.well-known/` goes in `tests/app/well-known/` or it silently never runs.
- Import test helpers from `bun:test`, never from `vitest`.
- A package that needs environment or a DOM configures it in its own `bunfig.toml` with a `tests-preload.ts`. DOM tests register happy-dom in that preload.
- Database tests run against the real Postgres from docker compose, in a transaction that rolls back. `scripts/test-env.ts` refuses to run against a database whose name does not contain `test`.
- Each package owns an isolated database (`tack_test_core`, `tack_test_svc`, `tack_test_rt`, `tack_test_rts`, `tack_test_mcp`, `tack_test_web`). Run `bun run db:test-setup` once after `bun run infra:up`, otherwise `bun run verify` fails on a clean checkout with connection errors rather than test failures.
- Two test runs at once need two lanes. Set `TACK_TEST_LANE` to anything unique and the suite uses `tack_test_core_<lane>` instead, where the lane is a readable stub plus a digest of the raw value so two lanes that normalise alike stay apart, cloned from the base database on first use, so a `resetDatabase` in one run cannot truncate tables out from under another. Without the variable nothing changes. This matters whenever several agents or worktrees run tests against the same Postgres: sharing one database shows up as deadlocks and foreign key violations that look like real failures. `TACK_TEST_LANE=<lane> bun run db:test-lanes-drop` removes the databases of that one lane and nothing else. With no `TACK_TEST_LANE` set it refuses and says so rather than guessing, because the old behaviour of dropping every lane deleted lanes other worktrees were running against. `bun run db:test-lanes-drop --all` is the explicit way back to a clean slate, and it takes every lane on that Postgres with it, including live ones. The six base databases are never dropped in either mode.
- End to end: Playwright in `apps/web/e2e`.
- A feature is not done until it has tests that would fail if the feature broke.

## Deployment

Tack is one Vercel project. The root directory is `apps/web`, the build runs
`bun run build` there, and functions serve on the node runtime. Nothing is
containerised and nothing runs in Kubernetes.

The node runtime is not optional. `/api/ws` upgrades through
`experimental_upgradeWebSocket` from `@vercel/functions`, and Vercel only injects
that upgrade bridge on node. Setting `bunVersion` in `apps/web/vercel.json` moves
every function to the bun runtime, where the upgrade silently never happens and
the client just retries against a socket that never opens.

Upgrade before doing any other work in that route. Awaiting redis, the database
or anything else first stops the handshake reaching a 101, so attach the hub
after the socket is open and buffer whatever arrives in between.

Functions run in `hnd1` because Supabase is in `ap-northeast-1`, and `regions`
in `apps/web/vercel.json` is what keeps them together. Vercel defaults to `iad1`,
which put every query on a Virginia to Tokyo round trip of about 170ms. A page
that reaches the database four times sequentially paid most of a second for it,
which is why tuning the queries themselves changed almost nothing: they run in
under 3ms and the trip to reach them was fifty times that. Move the database and
this line moves with it. Serving users from the region nearest them is the wrong
instinct here, because a page makes several database round trips and only one
trip from the browser.

Migrations are applied locally against the target database, never by a job in the
platform. Run `DIRECT_URL="postgres://..." bun run db:release` before merging code
that depends on a schema change. The command verifies the migration ledger, applies
pending migrations under a database lock and then compares columns, types,
nullability, defaults, generated columns, primary keys, indexes, foreign keys and
enum values against the declared schema. A production Vercel build fails closed if
that verification cannot run or finds the database behind.

## Git

- Branch per unit of work, PR into `main`, several small commits per PR.
- Commit subject in imperative mood, scoped: `feat(issues): add board drag reorder`.
- Never commit `.env`, uploads, or recordings.

## Review before merge

Two bots review this repository. **Greptile carries the most weight**: treat its
findings as the primary gate and work through them first. CodeRabbit is
secondary. It sometimes reports `Review rate limited`, which is not a real
review: when that happens, re-run it and wait for it to complete rather than
merging on the rate-limited result. Both reviews should complete before merge;
Greptile is the one whose findings are weighted most heavily.

Never merge while a review is still running, and never merge with a thread left
open. Green CI is not enough on its own. A merge state of `UNSTABLE` means a
review has not finished, so treat it as a block rather than a warning.

Before merging, merge the current `main` into the branch and let every check run
again against that merged state. A branch that is green against the `main` it
forked from proves nothing about the `main` it is about to land on, and with
several streams in flight `main` moves under all of them.

Each thread ends one of two ways, and both are acceptable:

- Fix the code, push the change, and resolve the thread.
- Disagree, reply on the thread explaining why the finding does not apply, and
  resolve it.

What is not acceptable is merging with a thread left open, or resolving one
silently without either a fix or a reply.
