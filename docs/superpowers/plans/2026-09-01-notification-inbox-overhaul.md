# Notification and Inbox Reliability Overhaul Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development (recommended) or superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** Replace per-event notification rows with durable, idempotent conversations and ordered Slack threads while preserving current inbox, realtime, MCP, and preference behavior through migration.

**Architecture:** PostgreSQL is the durable boundary for source ingestion, recipient fanout, conversation state, and provider delivery. Existing notification rows become immutable recipient events, conversation summaries provide the read model, and leased workers deliver Slack and email after commit.

**Tech Stack:** Bun, TypeScript, Next.js 16, Drizzle ORM, PostgreSQL, TanStack Query, Redis realtime, Slack Web API, Resend, Playwright

**Spec:** `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-01-notification-inbox-overhaul-design.md`

## Global Constraints

- Every command uses Bun as package manager and script runner.
- Shipped server code runs on Node and imports no Bun built-in.
- Code contains no explanatory comments, no `any`, no non-null assertions, and no em dash characters.
- External input is parsed by shared Zod schemas.
- Server authorization uses `packages/shared/src/policy`.
- Every implementation task starts with a failing test and ends with focused green tests.
- Schema-dependent application code is not enabled before the matching production database release.
