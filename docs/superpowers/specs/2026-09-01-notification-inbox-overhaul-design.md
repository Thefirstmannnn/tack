# Notification and Inbox Reliability Overhaul Design

## Status

Approved for implementation on 2026-09-01 with all eight recommended behavioral defaults accepted.

## Problem

Tack currently stores one inbox row per recipient and notification event. A busy pull request can
therefore produce separate rows for comments, inline comments, reviews, review requests, lifecycle
changes and failed checks. The same pull request may also use an Tack issue as its entity in one
event and the mirrored GitHub pull request in another. The inbox has no durable subject identity
that can group those rows.

There are reliability gaps beneath the visible duplication:

- GitHub domain effects and notifications commit before the webhook delivery is marked processed.
  A process failure in that gap lets the same delivery be reclaimed after its lease expires.
- Notification deduplication is a 60 second lookup over type, entity and URL rather than a database
  uniqueness guarantee tied to the source event.
- A pull request linked to more than one Tack issue can create one notification event per link for
  the same recipient.
- CI activities are rolled up across historical check rows without limiting them to the current pull
  request head SHA. Check runs, suites, workflow runs and commit statuses can each report the same
  underlying failure.
- Inbox tabs filter a raw page of 50 rows in the browser. A large run of pull request or status rows
  can starve another tab even when matching notifications exist on later pages.
- Read, snooze and delete state belongs to individual rows. Realtime deletes are not recoverable by
  catchup, and optimistic badge arithmetic can drift from the server.
- Slack direct messages have a durable delivery row, but each event is a new top-level message.
  Slack channel sends are synchronous after commit, errors do not fail the webhook, and only the
  first event title is used when one webhook creates several notifications.

The result is an inbox that is noisy, hard to trust and unable to drive a coherent Slack thread.

## Goals

- Show one inbox conversation per subject and notification family, with an immutable event history.
- Group every event for one GitHub pull request into one conversation for each recipient, regardless
  of event type, URL or linked Tack issue.
- Make source event ingestion idempotent with database constraints, including webhook redelivery and
  worker reclaim after a process failure.
- Count unread conversations rather than unread event rows.
- Apply Activity, Status, Unread, Mentions and Pull requests filters in the database before
  pagination.
- Scope CI state and failure notifications to the current pull request head SHA.
- Deliver Slack notifications through a durable outbox and keep later events in the same Slack
  thread for that destination and conversation.
- Report Slack and notification-email delivery only after provider confirmation.
- Preserve web, realtime and MCP behavior during a phased migration.
- Keep every authorization decision on the server and scoped to current workspace and team access.

## Non-goals

- A machine-learned priority inbox or user-configurable ranking.
- A second notification preference system.
- Slack actions that mutate Tack or GitHub.
- Combining unrelated Tack issues merely because their titles or URLs look similar.
- Replacing GitHub's pull request timeline. Tack keeps the notification events needed to explain an
  inbox conversation and links to GitHub for the complete source history.
- Product analytics or telemetry that leaves the installation.
- Deleting historical event rows during the first rollout.

## Behavioral decisions

### Conversation identity

Every event receives a canonical conversation key before recipient planning:

| Subject | Conversation key |
| --- | --- |
| GitHub pull request | `github-pr:<repository-id>:<number>` |
| Tack issue activity | `tack-issue:<issue-id>:activity` |
| Tack issue field changes | `tack-issue:<issue-id>:status` |
| Tack document activity | `tack-doc:<doc-id>:activity` |
| Tack project activity | `tack-project:<project-id>:activity` |
| Invitation or membership event | A stable domain key for that invitation or membership |
| Unresolvable legacy row | `legacy-notification:<notification-id>` |

Pull request events always use the mirrored pull request as the canonical subject. Linked Tack
issues remain related context resolved from `git_link`; they do not change the conversation key and
do not multiply notifications.

Issue field changes stay separate from issue activity. This preserves the current Activity and
Status distinction while still collapsing repeated status changes into one subject conversation.
Every GitHub pull request conversation has the fixed `activity` category, including failed checks.
It also appears in Pull requests by subject type. The Status category is reserved for Tack issue
field-change conversations, so mixed pull request history never makes category backfill ambiguous.

### Read, snooze and dismiss

- A conversation is unread when it contains at least one inbox event after its last read action or
  has an explicit manual-unread override.
- Marking a conversation read sets both unread event counts to zero and clears manual unread in the
  same transaction.
- Marking a conversation unread sets `manual_unread` without inventing an unread event or mention.
  The conversation counts once in the unread badge, while its unread event and mention counts remain
  zero until real activity arrives.
- Manual unread on an activity conversation increments total unread and unread activity. Manual
  unread on a status conversation increments only total unread. Neither form increments unread
  mentions.
- A newly inserted live event makes the conversation unread, clears a prior dismissal and clears a
  snooze so important new activity resurfaces.
- A backfill or stale event can extend history without changing unread, snooze or dismissal state.
- Delete in the UI becomes a soft dismissal of the conversation. Event history remains available for
  idempotency, audit and future activity.
- The header badge and tab counts count conversations, not event rows.
- Snoozed and dismissed conversations are excluded from visible counters without clearing their
  underlying unread state. Dismiss, snooze, wake and resurface transactions update every affected
  counter and its version atomically.
- Access-hidden conversations are also excluded from rows and counters. Regaining canonical-subject
  access clears `access_hidden_at`, advances its generation and restores counters from current unread,
  snooze and dismissal state without changing event read history.

### Tabs

- Activity contains conversations whose fixed category is activity.
- Status contains conversations whose fixed category is status.
- Unread contains every unread, visible conversation.
- Mentions contains conversations with at least one mention event. Its badge counts conversations
  with unread mention events.
- Pull requests contains conversations whose subject type is `github_pull_request`.
- Snoozed conversations are excluded until the snooze expires or a new live event arrives.
- Dismissed conversations are excluded until a new live event arrives.
- Access-hidden conversations are excluded until current policy grants the recipient access again.

Filters are server-side and use an opaque cursor over `(last_activity_seq, id)`. Every page contains up
to the requested number of matching conversations, so a noisy category cannot starve another tab.

                           store provider identity
```

The database transaction is the durable boundary. Realtime publication and provider calls happen
after commit. A publication failure is recoverable through sync catchup, and a provider failure is
recoverable through the outbox lease and retry policy.

## Data model

### `notification_source_event`

One row identifies one user-visible semantic event before recipient fanout. Raw domain mutation
idempotency remains in the owning domain or provider-delivery table, so a coarser notification key can
suppress repeat fanout without suppressing later state updates. The source row is also the idempotency
tombstone that survives inbox dismissal, legacy row deletion and future event pruning.

| Column | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `id` | UUIDv7 primary key |
| `organization_id`, `source_event_key` | Tenant-scoped immutable source identity |
| `source_delivery_id` | Provider delivery identity when one exists |
| `subject_type`, `subject_key` | Canonical subject known before recipient fanout |
| `occurred_at` | Provider or domain occurrence time for display |
| `ingested_at`, `ingestion_seq` | Tack ingestion time and sequence |
| `payload` | Shared-schema-validated normalized event snapshot |
| `fanout_completed_at` | Fence that closes ordinary recipient and provider enqueue |
| `pruned_at`, timestamps | Retention state and operations |

Unique `(organization_id, source_event_key)` is the exact notification-fanout gate. The source row is
never deleted by an inbox action. Ordinary fanout enqueues every recipient and provider row while
holding the source lock, then sets `fanout_completed_at` in the same effects transaction. A later
enqueue must also lock the source and is rejected when fanout is closed or `pruned_at` is non-null.
Payload pruning locks the source first and requires completed fanout. It is forbidden while any
related delivery is pending, processing, retryable, ambiguous or available for operator retry, or
while a reconciliation job can still require the normalized snapshot. It is allowed only after every
dependency is delivered or unavailable, or after an operator closes it with a validated immutable
delivery payload and hash
sufficient for every remaining operation. Pruning clears only the payload and retains the source
identity as a tombstone.

Retention dependency queries follow both canonical delivery rows and historical delivery-audit links.
Backfill never closes fanout while an audit delivery is nonterminal or unresolved, so a source payload
cannot be pruned around legacy provider work merely because that row has a null source id.

### `notification_conversation`

One row represents one recipient's inbox state for one canonical conversation key.

| Column | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `id` | UUIDv7 primary key and public conversation id |
| `organization_id`, `user_id` | Tenant and recipient boundary |
| `conversation_key` | Stable subject and family identity |
| `subject_type`, `subject_id` | Canonical entity used for policy and rendering |
| `category` | Fixed `activity` or `status` value |
| `latest_event_id` | Most recently surfaced event by ingestion order |
| `latest_type`, `latest_actor_name` | List row snapshot |
| `latest_title`, `latest_body` | List and detail snapshot |
| `latest_url`, `latest_external_url` | Tack and provider destinations |
| `latest_occurred_at` | Provider or domain occurrence time displayed to the user |
| `event_count` | Number of retained inbox events in the conversation |
| `unread_event_count` | Events received since the last read action |
| `unread_mention_count` | Mention events received since the last read action |
| `manual_unread` | Explicit unread override when no unread event remains |
| `last_mention_at` | Enables the Mentions tab without scanning history |
| `read_at` | Last explicit read action |
| `snoozed_until`, `dismissed_at` | Conversation-level visibility state |
| `access_hidden_at`, `access_generation` | Policy-driven visibility and restoration fence |
| `snooze_generation` | Fence for durable wake jobs and resnooze races |
| `last_activity_seq`, `last_activity_at` | Sequence for ordering plus ingestion time for display |
| `sync_id`, timestamps | Realtime catchup and operations |

Constraints and indexes:

- Unique `(organization_id, user_id, conversation_key)`.
- List index beginning with `(organization_id, user_id, category, last_activity_seq, id)`.
- Separate partial indexes for unread, mentions and pull requests where they improve measured query
  plans. Snooze lookup uses an ordinary `(organization_id, user_id, snoozed_until)` index or an
  immutable `snoozed_until IS NOT NULL` predicate, never a time-dependent index predicate.
- Check constraints keep counts non-negative and keep category within the supported values.
- Composite unique keys support tenant-safe event and conversation foreign keys.

### `notification_inbox_state`

One row per organization and user stores authoritative visible unread conversation, unread activity
and unread mention counts plus a `sync_id` counter version. Snoozed, dismissed and access-hidden rows
do not contribute. Every operation that can change those counts locks this row before locking
conversation rows in a stable key order. List, mutation and realtime payloads include the state
version, and clients ignore any counter snapshot older than the highest version already applied.

### `notification_snooze_wake`

One durable wake row is keyed by conversation id and snooze generation. It stores `wake_at`, lease
state, `claim_token`, attempts and completion state. Setting or extending a snooze increments the
conversation generation and enqueues its matching wake row in the same transaction. Explicitly
clearing snooze, dismissal and new live activity also advance the generation. A bounded worker claims
due rows, locks inbox state before the conversation, and clears the snooze only when both the
generation and `snoozed_until` still match. It then updates counters and versions and publishes a
non-sensitive visibility delta after commit. Older wake rows become unavailable rather than waking a
resnoozed, dismissed or newly active conversation.

### `notification`

The existing table becomes an immutable recipient event log. Expand migrations add nullable columns
so old and new code can coexist:

- `conversation_id`
- `source_event_id`
- `occurred_at`
- `ingested_at`
- `ingestion_seq`
- `surface_in_inbox`
- `dismissed_at`
- `manual_unread_anchor`
- `deduplicated_into_notification_id`

`manual_unread_anchor` is a temporary compatibility marker. It is true only when a
conversation-level manual-unread action must project into the legacy model by clearing the newest
active sibling's `read_at`. Folding treats that row as the manual override rather than as an unread
event. A legacy event-level unread action clears `read_at` with the marker false, so it remains a real
unread event. Mark-read and new live activity clear every stale anchor in the conversation.

The recipient constraint is unique `(source_event_id, user_id)`. The application uses
`INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING RETURNING`, and only returned recipient rows can change a
conversation or enqueue a direct-message delivery. The old 60 second dedupe window is removed after
all producers create durable source events.

`deduplicated_into_notification_id` is null for ordinary recipient events. During historical
backfill, each exact source-and-user equivalence group keeps its already linked row as the survivor when
one exists, otherwise it chooses the first row by `created_at` and id. The survivor receives the shared
source identity. Additional same-user rows keep their original immutable payload, point to the
survivor, set `surface_in_inbox` false and keep `source_event_id` null. They are audit duplicates, not
recipient events for counters, conversation snapshots or provider delivery. A tenant-safe foreign key
prevents a duplicate from pointing across organizations or users. A row-local check requires a
deduplicated row to have a null source id, false `surface_in_inbox` and a different survivor id. A
deferred constraint trigger locks and verifies the target at commit: it must have the same organization
and user, a non-null source id and no deduplication target. This makes self-links, chains and cycles
invalid rather than relying on application convention. The trigger also runs when a referenced
survivor's source or deduplication role changes and rejects its demotion while any inbound audit link
remains. It locks candidate survivor rows and inbound rows by id before validation.

Source keys describe the user-visible semantic event, not its presentation. Most map directly to a
GitHub delivery and normalized activity identity, an Tack comment id and create action, or an issue
sync id and changed field. A derived state transition can intentionally use a coarser key, such as one
current-head checks-failed event, while raw check activities continue updating their owning domain
rows. A GitHub notification key never includes a linked Tack issue id, so link fanout cannot create
duplicates for one recipient.

`occurred_at` records provider or domain time for display. `ingestion_seq` comes from a database
sequence after the relevant conversation row is locked and is the monotonic activity and read-order
boundary. `ingested_at` is the human-readable ingestion time. Delayed provider timestamps therefore
cannot move a conversation backward, corrupt a cursor or make a previously read event appear newer
than it was ingested.

During backfill, an ordinary canonical row's `surface_in_inbox` is exactly the legacy
`delivered_channels @> '["inbox"]'::jsonb` result. For an exact same-source, same-user group, the
survivor is surfaced when any member carried the inbox channel, and later audit duplicates are set
false. Before classification, the compatibility fold makes the survivor active when any member is
active and dismissed only when all members are dismissed. It snoozes the survivor only when every
active member has a future snooze, using the earliest wake time. A real unread member takes precedence
over a manual-unread anchor; otherwise any active anchor becomes the survivor's anchor. The fold also
preserves the union of confirmed legacy delivery channels. Email-only and Slack-only groups therefore
never appear in the inbox by accident. Conversation counts and latest snapshots use only surfaced rows.
Phase 1 adds `dismissed_at` to the legacy row before hard delete is removed. Phase 2 dual-writes and
backfills that value into conversation state without deleting event history.

The event has a tenant-safe composite foreign key to its conversation. The conversation's nullable
`latest_event_id` has the inverse tenant-safe composite foreign key. A conversation is created with
no latest event, the recipient event is inserted, and only then is `latest_event_id` updated, so the
relationship does not require deferred constraints.

### `notification_delivery`

The existing delivery table becomes the durable provider outbox for Slack direct messages, Slack
channel messages and notification email. It gains:

- `organization_id`
- `source_event_id`
- `conversation_key`
- `deduplicated_into_delivery_id`
- `destination_kind`
- `destination_id`
- `integration_id`, `slack_team_id`, `slack_app_id`
- `credential_generation`
- `provider_request_id`
- `provider_message_id`
- `provider_payload`, `provider_payload_hash`
- `provider_idempotency_expires_at`
- `claim_token`, `claimed_at`, `lease_expires_at`
- `send_started_at`
- `dead_lettered_at`

`notification_id` and `user_id` remain required for a direct-message or email destination. They
become nullable for a shared channel destination, whose outbox row carries its own validated event
payload snapshot and must not be deleted because one representative user leaves the workspace.
Database checks enforce the required shape for each destination kind.

Slack destinations always carry their enqueue-time team and app identity. A worker compares those
values and the credential generation with the locked current integration before any provider call.
Every reconnect first enters a durable draining state that stops new claims. A reconnect to a
different team or app waits for active delivery and root leases to complete or become reconciled or
ambiguous, then atomically activates the new identity, marks old pending deliveries unavailable and
archives old thread rows. Rotation within the same provider namespace uses the same drain, preserves
eligible threads and still uses credential generation as a send-time race fence.

Unique `(organization_id, source_event_id, channel, destination_kind, destination_id)` for rows whose
source id is non-null and `deduplicated_into_delivery_id` is null prevents a single source event from
reaching the same destination more than once. A channel delivery is created once per configured
channel, not once per user notification. Existing lease, attempt and retry fields remain the worker
contract.

`deduplicated_into_delivery_id` is used only for classified legacy provider records. The target is the
canonical row for that source, provider and destination. A deduplicated row retains confirmed provider
ids and audit history but is never claimable. Before workers resume, it must be terminal `delivered` or
`unavailable`; an uncertain provider result remains an explicit migration blocker until reconciled. A
deferred constraint trigger enforces a same-organization canonical target with a non-null source and no
deduplication target, preventing self-links, chains and cycles. It also fires on canonical-role changes
and rejects demotion while an inbound delivery audit link exists, using target-then-inbound id order.

Delivery state has one meaning for every provider: `pending` is queued, `processing` is leased,
`delivered` has a confirmed provider identity, `failed` is retryable, `unavailable` is a permanent
recipient or configuration condition, `ambiguous` needs operator reconciliation, and `dead_letter`
exhausted its retry policy. During the
compatibility window, a channel is added to `notification.delivered_channels` only after provider
confirmation. The final model reads status from delivery rows and stops mutating that compatibility
field. Every notification provider uses these state meanings rather than being marked delivered at
planning time.

Every provider claim requires a non-null source id, a null delivery deduplication target and, when it
has a notification owner, a null recipient deduplication target. Audit duplicates can never re-enter
`pending`, `processing` or `failed` through retry or operator tooling.

Every claim or reclaim writes a fresh UUID claim token. Completion and failure updates require both
the delivery id and active claim token and return the updated row. Zero returned rows means the lease
was lost and the worker cannot finalize provider state. A processing lease that expires after a
provider call may have succeeded, so it becomes `ambiguous` unless provider reconciliation or a
provider idempotency guarantee proves it was not sent. It is never converted blindly into an
ordinary retryable failure.

After a worker owns a delivery lease, its final provider preflight locks the canonical policy root and
every linked-resource ACL, membership or destination-mapping dependency in the global order, using a
stable parent for any absent child, and locks the delivery row last. Access-removal transactions use
the same prefix before inbox state, conversations and affected deliveries, so neither path holds a
delivery while waiting for policy. The preflight re-evaluates authorization and records
`send_started_at` with the active claim token before releasing the database connection. This is the
delivery authorization linearization point. If revocation commits first, provider contact is
forbidden. If preflight commits first, the provider call is already in flight and revocation cancels
only later work. An expired lease with `send_started_at` and no confirmed provider result is ambiguous.

Provider and destination shapes are explicit:

| Destination | Required identity | Send-time resolution and policy |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Slack direct message | `notification_id`, `user_id`, integration, team, app and mapped Slack user | Recheck current recipient access, `slack_dm` preference, membership and mapping; resolve or open the current DM channel |
| Slack shared channel | `source_event_id`, integration, team, app and enabled channel mapping | Recheck canonical-subject visibility against the mapping's workspace or team scope; no representative user owns the row |
| Notification email | `notification_id`, `user_id`, stable user destination and provider request id | Recheck current recipient access and email preference, then resolve the current verified address immediately before send |

The unique delivery key includes source event, provider and stable destination identity. Raw email
addresses are not uniqueness keys and are not frozen at enqueue time. The delivery id derives the
provider idempotency key, and the confirmed provider message id is stored on success.

There is no production notification email executor today. The overhaul therefore enqueues
notification email as another durable destination and adds a Resend worker before enabling email
delivery claims. Non-notification email can continue using its existing path. Tack never marks an
email delivered merely because it was planned. Missing verified email, a disabled current
preference or lost subject access makes a queued email unavailable without contacting Resend.
The email worker uses the same claim-token and lease finalization contract as Slack, reloads the
source event, recipient and canonical subject after claim, and sends with the delivery-derived
idempotency key. Immediately before first provider contact it resolves the current verified address,
renders the validated request and atomically stores an encrypted immutable provider payload, its hash
and the provider idempotency expiry. Every retry uses that exact payload and key; an address change
never mutates an already attempted request. The frozen address must still be the recipient's current
verified address before a retry; otherwise a definitively unsent row becomes unavailable and a row
that may have reached Resend becomes ambiguous. A different-payload idempotency conflict is ambiguous.
Automatic retries stop before Resend's 24-hour key retention expires, and an unconfirmed delivery is
marked ambiguous rather than risking a duplicate after expiry. Only a confirmed Resend provider id
moves the row to delivered.

Existing Slack direct-message rows migrate under a paused worker after every active lease has either
completed or expired and after recipient-owned delivery duplicates are classified:

- `succeeded` becomes `delivered` and keeps provider channel and timestamp ids.
- `skipped` becomes `unavailable` with its existing reason.
- `pending` and `failed` are backfilled only when integration, Slack team, destination mapping and
  conversation are unambiguous, the row is canonical and its notification owner is not an audit
  duplicate; otherwise they become `unavailable` with a legacy-resolution reason.
- Expired legacy `processing` rows become `ambiguous` unless logs or provider reconciliation prove
  that no provider call began; only definitively unsent rows return to `failed` with attempts
  preserved.
- A provider-boundary uncertainty becomes the explicit `ambiguous` state and is never treated as
  ordinary retryable failure.

### `slack_notification_thread`

| Column | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `integration_id` | Slack workspace credential owner |
| `slack_team_id`, `slack_app_id` | Provider namespace that owns channel and message ids |
| `credential_generation` | Send-time fence for reconnect or token rotation races |
| `destination_kind`, `destination_id` | Channel or direct message destination |
| `conversation_key` | Tack conversation identity |
| `channel_id` | Slack channel-like id returned by the API |
| `root_ts` | Parent message timestamp |
| `state` | `creating`, `ready`, `blocked`, `ambiguous` or `archived` |
| `created_by_delivery_id` | Delivery that owns root creation |
| `claim_token`, `claimed_at`, `lease_expires_at` | Fenced root-creation lease |
| `last_error` | Recoverable root-creation diagnostics |
| `sync_id`, timestamps | Recovery and inspection |

Unique `(integration_id, slack_team_id, slack_app_id, destination_kind, destination_id,
conversation_key)` guarantees one thread per Slack provider namespace, destination and Tack
conversation. A token rotation for the same team and app can retain the thread, but every send is
fenced against the current credential generation. A team or app identity change starts a new thread
and cannot reuse old channel or timestamp ids.

For same-team and same-app rotation, the post-drain transaction increments the integration
generation, rebinds eligible pending and failed deliveries plus ready thread rows with
compare-and-swap updates, activates the new credential and resumes claims. A processing row is never
silently rebound across generations. For a team or app identity change, no old destination or thread
is rebound and the new namespace starts empty.

### `webhook_delivery` additions

Add nullable `claim_token` and `replay_of_delivery_id` columns during Phase 1. Provider delivery
identity becomes nullable only for internal replay rows. A shape check requires exactly one of provider
delivery identity or `replay_of_delivery_id`; provider identity keeps its provider-scoped unique index,
and `replay_of_delivery_id` has its own unique partial index. Every fresh claim or expired-lease reclaim
writes a new UUID and the existing lease timestamps in one compare-and-swap update. Success and failure
finalization both require the active token. Existing pending and failed rows receive a token only
when next claimed; existing processing rows keep their current lease and are reclaimed with a fresh
token after expiry. A stale claimant that cannot return its row from finalization must roll back its
domain effects transaction.

The rollout is fail-closed across old deployments. First pause new webhook claims, wait for every
old-handler processing lease to finish or expire, and verify that no tokenless row remains processing.
Then add and validate a check requiring a non-null token whenever status is `processing`, deploy the
token-aware claimant and resume. An old deployment can no longer claim under that constraint, and a
tokenless finalizer cannot update a freshly claimed row. The pause remains available for rollback
until every allowed deployment understands claim tokens.

A `webhook_delivery_quarantine` row is keyed by the parent webhook delivery's immutable internal id, so
it can exist before organization or installation routing succeeds. It stores nullable organization
attribution, a non-sensitive scope-kind and scope-key hash for unresolved operations, encrypted payload
ciphertext, encryption-key version, parser schema version, reason code, sanitized diagnostics,
quarantined time, replay request identity, replacement delivery id, replayed time and terminal
disposition. Parent and quarantine organization attribution are nullable with `ON DELETE SET NULL`.
The parent and child use deletion-restricted linkage during active retention, but neither depends on a
live organization foreign key for identity.

Quarantined parents and ciphertext are exempt from the ordinary 30-day hard prune until successful
replay or explicit operator resolution. After the approved quarantine retention window, cleanup may
clear parent payload and child ciphertext while retaining a minimal parent-and-child audit tombstone
with the provider delivery hash, reason, parser version, disposition and replacement link. Organization
deletion locks the parent, quarantine and replacement, invalidates any active replacement claim and
makes nonterminal replay unavailable before clearing ciphertext and tenant content. It then nulls live
organization attribution and records an `organization_deleted` disposition without blocking the
organization delete. Only the non-sensitive global delivery hash and replay audit remain for the
separately defined security-audit retention, after which that deletion workflow may remove both
tombstones.

A correctly signed delivery whose required GitHub identity fails shared-schema normalization enters a
terminal `quarantined` state and writes the linked quarantine row in the same transaction. The
transition requires the active webhook claim token and one returned parent row. The validated envelope
and original payload remain available for diagnosis without entering logs, but the delivery creates no
source, domain, inbox or provider effects and is never retried automatically. Unresolved-scope rows are
visible only to audited platform operators; organization administrators gain access only after a
fenced routing update binds the parent to their organization. This parent-keyed quarantine remains
addressable even when a missing installation, SHA, app or check name makes tenant or context routing
impossible.

Replay scheduling is one short transaction guarded by a fresh quarantine replay claim token. It locks
the parent and quarantine row, allocates the replacement id once, inserts one internal webhook delivery
with unique `replay_of_delivery_id`, leaves its provider delivery id null, and stores the same
replacement id on the quarantine row. A crash commits neither side or both sides; a retry returns the
existing replacement and never creates another. The replacement uses the ordinary webhook claim-token
and lease state machine, reads the original validated envelope and ciphertext, and derives domain and
source idempotency from the original provider identity. Its successful effects transaction finalizes
the replacement and records the quarantine's `replayed_at` and terminal disposition atomically under
the replacement claim token. Parser failure or a worker crash retries the same replacement row. Ciphertext
cannot be cleared while that row is pending, processing, retryable or ambiguous.

### GitHub activity additions

`github_check_activity` is the repository-scoped append-only owner for every direct check-run,
commit-status and reconciliation-fetch activity. Direct webhook rows are unique by organization,
repository, provider delivery, stable activity identity and provider update version. Reconciliation
rows are unique by fetch attempt, stable provider object identity and provider update version. They
carry the head SHA, source kind and normalized context key and exist even when no pull request is
mirrored.

`github_check_reconciliation_fetch` is one durable lifecycle row per provider request attempt. Before
the provider call, a short head-locked transaction validates the claim and commits a new attempt id,
captured job version and context generation, request time and `started` disposition. After the call,
the worker records completion time, normalized result hash, sanitized failure and a `fetched` or
`failed` disposition. State acceptance later changes `fetched` to `accepted` or `invalidated`; a lost
lease changes `started` or `fetched` to `abandoned` or `invalidated`. A retry always receives a new
attempt id, including within one job version. Normalized check activities are persisted under that
attempt before the state compare-and-swap, so every issued request and every available invalidated
response remains auditable without changing current contexts.

A `github_check_head_context` row keyed by organization, repository, head SHA and context key stores
current state, provider update time, latest provider run id, active or superseded state, a monotonic
context version, latest raw check activity id, reconciliation state and a fenced reconciliation lease.
A `github_pull_request_check_context` row binds that head-scoped context to a pull request and records
the captured head epoch, projected context version, latest raw activity id and nullable
pull-request-specific notification source event id used for its aggregate projection.
`github_pull_request_activity` remains the append-only owner for pull-request-native activity and may
reference a repository-scoped check activity when that check produces a pull-request conversation
event.

A `github_check_head_reconciliation` row keyed by organization, repository and head SHA stores job
state, a monotonic job version, a monotonic context generation, trigger identity, attempts, settle
deadline, claim token, lease, accepted fetch attempt id, accepted job version and the latest validated
normalized context snapshot. It does not require a pull request to exist. Every accepted direct
check-run or commit-status mutation locks this row, updates its head-scoped context and advances the
context generation. A separate
`github_pull_request_reconciliation` row keyed by pull request stores the job version, conflicting head
candidates, claim token and lease for authoritative pull request reload. The pull request row gains a
`head_epoch` and normalized provider update time. It remains the source of truth for current `head_sha`
and aggregate `check_status`.

Every webhook activity stores a provider-delivery id plus a stable activity index or provider object
id and update version, with a tenant-scoped uniqueness constraint independent of notification sources.
Every reconciliation attempt stores its fetch id, check-head job id, provider object id and provider
update version as repository-scoped raw provenance before attempting to update current state. Pending,
success, repeated failure, rejected stale results and superseded activities therefore remain auditable
before a pull request exists and when no user-visible transition creates a notification source row.

`context_key` uses a versioned, length-delimited tuple encoding rather than concatenated display
text. A check-run key is `(check_run, app_id, check_name)`, where `app_id` is the validated
`check_run.app.id` and `check_name` is the validated non-empty `check_run.name`. The check name is
preserved exactly as parsed, without trimming, case folding or Unicode normalization.
`check_run.id` remains event and audit metadata rather than context identity. A rerun with a new run
id for the same app, name and head updates one context; different names from one app and the same name
from different apps remain separate. A commit-status key is
`(commit_status, case_fold(provider_context))` because GitHub's native combined-status identity is
case-insensitive and independent of the creator. The original context and creator remain metadata for
display and audit; neither a casing change nor a token or user rotation creates a second current
context. Check suites and workflow runs are reconciliation triggers and never create context rows.
Check-run and commit-status sources remain separate unless a future explicit provider adapter declares
a stable cross-source equivalence; the generic ingester never guesses that equivalence. Missing or
malformed check-run app or name identity fails normalization and terminally quarantines the parent
webhook delivery instead of creating a fallback context key.

The head context row is the durable context-scoped reconciliation job: a bounded worker claims
unresolved rows, reloads the current GitHub context and conditionally resolves it only when the claim
token, context version and owning head context generation still match. An accepted result updates the
head context and advances the generation atomically. It then projects the accepted state only into
pull requests whose head SHA and captured head epoch still match.

The check-head row owns a full check-context fetch with two independent fences. Every valid check-suite
or workflow-run trigger upserts it even when no mirrored pull request or constituent check run exists.
Every trigger increments the job version and moves a completed or failed job to pending. A trigger that
arrives during processing advances the job version and records `rerun_required`, so the old claimant
cannot finalize and the row returns to pending after that attempt releases its lease. The claimant also
captures the context generation before its provider fetch. Applying the fetched snapshot locks the
head row and succeeds only when the claim token, job version and captured context generation still
match. A direct check-run or status accepted after the fetch began advances the generation, rejects the
stale replacement and rearms the job.

After committing the `started` attempt and making the provider call, the worker records every available
normalized raw activity and the attempt result without changing current state. It then opens one state
transaction, locks the head row, locks the attempt and performs the compare-and-swap. A rejected
compare-and-swap marks the attempt invalidated and rearms the job. A successful compare-and-swap
atomically replaces the active head-scoped context set, advances the context generation, stores the
accepted fetch attempt and job version, and binds the accepted contexts to every currently matching
pull request in stable order before marking the job completed and the attempt accepted.
A trigger cannot interleave between snapshot acceptance and those existing pull-request projections
because it needs the same head lock.

A reclaimer locks the head before its attempt rows and marks a still-`started` attempt abandoned or a
still-`fetched` attempt invalidated when its claim lease is lost before the state transaction. A late
response may append its result hash and raw activities to an already terminal attempt but cannot
resurrect it or change current state. The reclaimer creates a new attempt for the next provider call and
never deletes or reuses the prior attempt's raw activities.

With no matching pull request, the head contexts remain durable for a later pull request synchronize or
mirror operation. That later binder locks the head row and may project only when the job is absent or is
completed without `rerun_required`, the accepted job version still equals the current job version and
the context generation remains stable through the bind. A newer suite or workflow trigger advances the
job version and moves it to pending, so an older accepted snapshot cannot bind to a newly mirrored pull
request. An unambiguous direct context update may advance the current generation while no full-head job
is pending; the later binder reads those current head contexts rather than an old snapshot. An empty
fetch stays retryable until the settle deadline with bounded backoff rather than completing the only
trigger; reaching the deadline persists an explicit empty snapshot through the same fences. A
non-current head can gain historical contexts but cannot affect the current rollup.

The pull-request reconciliation worker reloads the authoritative GitHub pull request and conditionally
changes `head_sha` only when its job token and version plus the captured pull request epoch still match.
An accepted correction increments `head_epoch` and upserts the repository-and-head check job for the
authoritative SHA. The check-head worker never chooses the pull request's current SHA.

If a newer event reuses one `check_run.id` for a different check name on the same app and head, the
head lock prevents both keys from remaining active. The worker advances the context generation, marks
the affected head contexts unresolved, suppresses their aggregate transition and enqueues the
repository-and-head check job. That fetch requests GitHub's latest check runs for the head and, through
the generation compare-and-swap, atomically replaces the active check-run context set and marks
provider-absent contexts superseded. Superseded rows remain history but do not participate in the
aggregate. A later distinct run can reactivate the same app and name through a newer provider update.

Every direct check mutation, context reconciliation, full-head reconciliation and pull-request bind
uses the same domain lock order: repository rows by organization and repository id, head rows by SHA,
fetch-attempt rows by id, head contexts by encoded context key, pull requests by id, then pull-request
context projections. CAS, invalidation and reclaim paths all lock head before attempt. A result-only
transaction may lock its attempt without a head only when it will not acquire any later lock class. A
worker never holds an attempt, pull-request or projection lock while waiting for a head row. The
full-head compare-and-swap and direct context generation increment therefore serialize without
deadlocking, and multi-pull-request binding cannot reverse the order.

## Transaction and concurrency rules

Normalize the complete webhook or domain mutation into semantic events, canonical targets, policy
root keys and candidate audience inputs before taking locks. This planning is not an authorization
result. Then, in one effects transaction:

1. Compute the raw domain idempotency identity, potential conversation fields and canonical subject.
2. Lock each canonical policy root in
   `(organization_id, resource_type, resource_id)` order. The root fences changes to its linked-resource
   set and is the stable parent when a child ACL can be absent.
3. Reload current linked resources under their roots and combine them with every dependency named by
   the proposed mutation to compute the complete policy child set.
4. Lock every linked-resource ACL, workspace or team membership and destination mapping in stable
   `(organization_id, dependency_type, scope_id, principal_or_destination_id)` order. An absent
   membership, ACL or mapping uses its stable parent scope as the lock target. Grant, revoke, link and
   mapping mutations use the same roots and child order.
5. Apply every raw domain mirror change idempotently under its owning root and child locks, recompute
   current state and derive any user-visible transition. A repeated raw event can no-op its domain
   mutation, but a conflict on a coarser notification identity never suppresses a different raw state
   update.
6. Re-resolve the authorized audience and shared destinations from current locked state. A recipient
   or destination absent from this final result creates no inbox or provider effect.
7. For every derived user-visible transition, compute `source_event_key`, `conversation_key` and
   category, then insert `notification_source_event` rows with
   `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING RETURNING` in stable source-key order.
8. Stop only inbox and provider fanout for a transition when no source row was returned. Its raw
   domain update remains committed with the rest of the effects transaction.
9. Insert or lock every required `notification_inbox_state` in
   `(organization_id, user_id)` order.
10. Insert conversation shells and lock every required conversation in
   `(organization_id, user_id, conversation_key)` order.
11. Allocate each recipient event's ingestion sequence while holding its conversation lock.
12. Insert the immutable recipient event with its source, conversation and ingestion ids using
   `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING RETURNING`.
13. Only when the recipient insert returned a row, update the conversation snapshot, inbox state and
   recipient-specific deliveries.
14. Enqueue each shared-channel delivery once from the source event and destination identity.
15. Set `fanout_completed_at` for every newly inserted source after all recipient and shared-destination
    planning is complete, including a zero-recipient path.
16. After every semantic event and zero-recipient path is complete, finalize the GitHub delivery once
   with its active claim token.

Candidate planning outside the transaction can therefore never authorize a recipient insert. Live
ingestion, grants, revocations, link changes, mapping changes and backfill share every policy lock that
can affect the audience, and recipient events, conversation visibility and deliveries reflect
authorization at the effects transaction's commit.

The webhook finalization uses
`UPDATE ... WHERE status = 'processing' AND claim_token = :token RETURNING id`. Returning zero rows
throws and rolls back the entire effects transaction because another worker reclaimed the lease.
Claim ownership is therefore a fence, not an advisory check.

The global lock-class order is canonical policy root, policy child dependency, notification source
event, inbox state, conversations, legacy event rows and provider deliveries. A transaction acquires
only the classes it needs but never acquires an earlier class after a later one. Roots use
`(organization_id, resource_type, resource_id)`, policy children use
`(organization_id, dependency_type, scope_id, principal_or_destination_id)`, and source rows use
`(organization_id, source_event_key)`. Live notification ingestion, source-linking backfill, access
changes and provider preflight use the applicable prefix; recipient or dependency iteration order from
a payload is never used as lock order.
Within recipient state, every path locks inbox-state rows first, conversation rows second and affected
legacy event rows last in stable `(organization_id, user_id, conversation_id, id)` order. A legacy
event mutation resolves its conversation without locking, acquires that same aggregate-first lock set,
then rechecks and mutates the target event before folding all locked siblings. Conversation row
locking serializes read and new-event races. The two valid orders are deterministic:

- Read first, then event: the new event leaves the conversation unread.
- Event first, then read: the read action covers that event and leaves the conversation read.

An out-of-order or backfill event is retained for history but does not replace a newer list snapshot
or resurface the conversation unless the producer explicitly marks it live and current. GitHub old
head and stale snapshot events are never marked live.

## GitHub ingestion and CI state

GitHub recommends using `X-GitHub-Delivery` as the stable identity for an event and preserves it on
redelivery. Tack keeps the existing exclusive claim but moves finalization into the domain-effects
transaction. A crash can then leave either no effects and a reclaimable claim, or committed effects
and a terminal delivery, never committed effects with a reclaimable delivery.

Pull request notification planning changes from one pass per linked issue to one pass per canonical
pull request. The service unions and authorizes audiences across linked issues, removes the actor and
then creates at most one recipient event per source key. Related Tack issue links are loaded for the
detail view.

A payload that names several pull requests computes its audience independently for each canonical
pull request. Authors, requested reviewers and linked-issue readers from one pull request are never
reused for another pull request in the same check payload.

After commit, realtime publication is best effort for the request path. A publication failure is
logged and recovered by sync catchup; it does not turn a terminal GitHub delivery back into a failed
or reclaimable delivery.

CI state follows these rules:

- Normalize `head_sha` from `check_run.head_sha`, `check_suite.head_sha`,
  `workflow_run.head_sha` and top-level `status.sha`. The result is the checked commit and is compared
  with the locked pull request head rather than assumed to be current. A missing or malformed source
  SHA terminally quarantines the provider delivery before activity or context planning.
- Lock the repository row and repository-and-head reconciliation row before applying a check event.
  Upsert its head context and advance the context generation first, then lock matching pull requests
  in stable id order to project the accepted state.
- Derive `context_key` with the versioned source-specific tuple rules above. Verify that reruns from
  one app and name update one row, equal names from different apps remain independent, status context
  casing and creator rotation update one native context, and check-run/status sources do not collapse
  without an explicit adapter.
- Order pull request head updates by the normalized provider pull request update time. Ignore an older
  head update. Equal provider times with different SHAs mark the pull request unresolved and enqueue
  the fenced pull-request reconciliation row instead of moving the head arbitrarily.
- Persist a check event for a non-current SHA in its head context but do not include it in a pull
  request's current aggregate. This preserves an early check that arrives before its synchronize event
  or before the pull request mirror exists.
- On an accepted pull request head change, increment `head_epoch`, reset aggregate state, bind every
  already stored resolved head context for the new SHA and recompute from those projections. Upsert the
  repository-and-head check job for unresolved or missing current-head contexts before emitting a
  failure transition.
- Upsert a head context while holding its repository-and-head row. Accept a state only when its
  normalized provider update time is newer than the stored value, then advance the head context
  generation. An older update remains raw history and cannot change the head context or aggregate.
- Treat equal provider times with different states as a reconciliation condition instead of choosing
  an arbitrary ingestion order. Mark the context unresolved, exclude the conflicting update from
  aggregate transitions, and fetch the authoritative current context from GitHub with a fenced
  reconciliation job. Equal time and equal state is idempotent.
- Keep the latest resolved state per repository, head SHA and context key. The unique head context plus
  its head-row lock serializes concurrent check sources. Pull-request projection occurs afterward under
  stable pull-request locks. Old-head rows remain history but never participate in a current rollup.
- Persist every raw check or status activity in the repository-and-head activity log independently of
  pull-request existence and notification-source creation. A head context points only to its latest
  raw activity. Each pull-request projection independently points to its optional PR-specific
  user-visible source. When a pull request appears, bind its stored head contexts before computing the
  current-head aggregate.
- Treat every valid check-suite and workflow-run event as a durable repository-and-head check trigger,
  including when no pull request or constituent check run is available yet. They never compete with
  check runs as separate aggregate contexts.
- Emit `pr_checks_failed` only when the aggregate current-head state transitions from a non-failure
  state to failure. Additional failed jobs on the same failing head do not create another event.
- Use source identity `github-pr:<repository-id>:<number>:<head-sha>:checks-failed`, so a
  failure-success-failure sequence on the same head still notifies at most once.
- A new head can produce one new failure event.
- Context reconciliation completion uses compare-and-swap on the context version, owning head context
  generation and claim token, then projects only through a captured pull-request head epoch and current
  SHA. Check-head snapshot replacement uses the check-job version, claim token and captured head
  context generation; snapshot acceptance and binding existing pull requests share one transaction.
  A later binder also requires the current completed job version, no rerun flag, a stable context
  generation and each pull request's captured epoch. Pull-request reconciliation uses its own job
  version, claim token and captured epoch. A direct context event, force push or newer trigger
  invalidates stale worker results.

## Slack delivery and threading

Every Slack side effect is claimed from `notification_delivery`. The webhook request never calls
Slack directly and never treats a swallowed provider error as success.

The Slack worker flow is:

1. Read a bounded set of candidate provider-namespace, destination and conversation keys without
   taking delivery locks, then enter one short claim transaction per key.
2. In that transaction, create or lock the unique Slack thread row first, select its lowest eligible
   delivery with `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`, reject the claim while a lower sequence is pending,
   processing, failed or ambiguous, and write the delivery claim token and lease.
3. Reload the source event and canonical subject. For direct messages, recheck current recipient
   policy, `slack_dm` preference, membership and mapping. For shared channels, recheck the current
   enabled mapping and its workspace or team scope against the subject.
4. Resolve the current integration and credential generation.
5. If no root exists, lease root creation, post the conversation summary and persist its `channel` and
   `ts`.
6. Otherwise post the new event with the root `ts` as `thread_ts`.
7. Persist provider ids and mark the delivery sent in one short transaction using the active claim
   and credential-generation fences.
8. Retry rate limits and only structured failures that prove Slack accepted no message. Treat unknown
   transport results plus provider `internal_error` or `fatal_error` responses after `send_started_at`
   as ambiguous. Mark permanent configuration errors unavailable and authentication errors as
   requiring reconnection.
9. Move exhausted deliveries to a visible dead-letter state rather than dropping them.

An enabled `slack_channel_sync` mapping is the authority for shared-channel delivery after cutover;
individual `slack_dm` preferences remain authoritative only for direct messages. Legacy per-user
`slack` preference rows are shadow-compared during compatibility and then retired for shared
channels, because one public channel side effect cannot honor different choices for individual
recipient rows. The settings UI labels shared channels as workspace or team managed before this
change is enabled.

The thread lease prevents concurrent workers from creating two roots without holding a database
connection across the Slack request. An expired lease can be reclaimed. A worker that loses its lease
cannot finalize the thread row.

The atomic claim transaction locks the thread row and admits at most one processing delivery per
provider namespace, destination and conversation. Its predicate selects the lowest eligible ingestion
sequence and rejects a candidate while any lower sequence is pending, processing, failed or ambiguous.
A partial unique index on `(organization_id, channel, integration_id, slack_team_id, slack_app_id,
destination_kind, destination_id, conversation_key)` for Slack rows where status is `processing`
backs the claim rule independently of the source-event delivery key. Replies cannot be claimed until
the thread is `ready`. An expired
`creating` lease is reclaimable only when `send_started_at` is null or Slack definitively rejected the
call. Once a call may have reached Slack, an unconfirmed root becomes ambiguous and cannot be replaced
automatically because that could create a second parent. It blocks replies until provider or operator
reconciliation records the original result or an operator explicitly authorizes a duplicate-risk
retry.

Any ambiguous delivery is a head-of-line barrier for its provider namespace, destination and
conversation. Claim queries exclude every higher ingestion sequence until the ambiguous root or reply
is reconciled, made unavailable or explicitly retried by an operator. Resolving an older reply can
therefore never place it after a later automatic reply.

The provider request id is an Tack correlation identity derived from the delivery id. Slack's
documented `chat.postMessage` contract has no caller-supplied idempotency guarantee, so Tack neither
sends nor relies on `client_msg_id`. Database uniqueness prevents duplicate outbox rows, not duplicate
Slack posts. A structured Slack rejection that confirms no message was accepted remains retryable. A
timeout, unknown transport result or process exit after `send_started_at` and before persisting
`channel` and `ts` makes the delivery and any creating root ambiguous. Automatic workers never issue a
second `chat.postMessage` for that delivery without confirmed reconciliation.

Root replies use `reply_broadcast: false`. Direct messages and configured channels use the same
threading model. Channel delivery deduplication happens before recipient fanout, so one pull request
event produces one reply per configured channel.

Workspace-scoped channel mappings receive only subjects visible to the workspace. Team-scoped
mappings receive only subjects currently visible to that team. A private or unresolvable subject has
no eligible shared-channel destination. Losing subject access, disabling a mapping or changing its
scope before claim marks the queued row unavailable without calling Slack.

The current worker claims at most 100 direct messages per one-minute cron run with concurrency five.
The first release keeps those safety limits, runs channel and direct-message capacity independently,
and exposes oldest-pending age. A sustained age above five minutes is an operational signal to tune
batch size or schedule frequency after checking Slack rate limits, not a reason to drop deliveries.

## API contracts

### List conversations

`GET /api/inbox/conversations?tab=<tab>&cursor=<opaque>&limit=<n>`

Returns:

- `conversations`: latest snapshot, unread state, event count and related context summary
- `counters`: authoritative conversation counts for total unread, unread mentions and unread activity
- `counterVersion`: inbox-state sync id for stale-response rejection
- `nextCursor`

Pagination is a live feed rather than a frozen snapshot. If an older conversation receives activity
between pages, its `last_activity_seq` moves it above the cursor. Realtime upserts bring that row to the
top immediately, the client deduplicates by conversation id, and a socket reconnect refreshes the
first page before older pagination resumes. This avoids pretending that a mutable summary row can
provide historical snapshot ordering without a second versioned index.

### Read history

`GET /api/inbox/conversations/:id/events?cursor=<opaque>&limit=<n>`

Returns immutable events newest first. The server verifies that the current principal owns the
conversation and still has canonical-subject access under current workspace, team and document
policy.

### Mutations

- `POST /api/inbox/conversations/read` accepts up to 500 conversation ids and a read boolean.
- `POST /api/inbox/conversations/read-all` marks every currently visible conversation read.
- `PATCH /api/inbox/conversations/:id` sets or clears snooze state and advances the snooze
  generation so obsolete wake jobs cannot change visibility.
- `DELETE /api/inbox/conversations/:id` soft-dismisses the conversation.

Every mutation returns authoritative counters, their version and updated conversation rows. The
client does not maintain independent badge arithmetic after the cutover and ignores a response whose
counter version is older than its current version.

### Compatibility

The existing `/api/notifications` routes remain during dual-read rollout. Phase 1 delete writes the
legacy `notification.dismissed_at` field and never physically deletes an event. As soon as Phase 2
conversation rows exist, every legacy or conversation read, unread, snooze and delete mutation uses
the bidirectional folding contract before backfill starts and until legacy clients are retired. No
compatibility route physically deletes an event or source identity.

Grouped state has deterministic legacy folding rules during this window:

- A surfaced sibling is active when its legacy `dismissed_at` is null.
- The conversation is dismissed when no surfaced sibling is active.
- The conversation is snoozed only when every active sibling has a future `snoozed_until`; its wake
  time is the earliest of those values. One visible active sibling keeps the conversation visible.
- Event and mention unread counts fold from active siblings whose `read_at` is null and whose
  `manual_unread_anchor` is false. Any active anchor folds into conversation `manual_unread` without
  increasing an event or mention count. The conversation snapshot uses the newest visible active
  sibling, then the newest active sibling, then the newest surfaced sibling when all are dismissed.
- A legacy event-level mutation first locks inbox state, conversation and sibling event rows in the
  global order, then changes exactly its target row and recomputes from all locked surfaced siblings.
  This preserves event ids and `mark_notification_read` semantics without inverting lock order.
- A conversation-level read, snooze or dismiss action locks the same aggregate-first set and writes
  the equivalent state to all active surfaced siblings in the same transaction. Marking a
  conversation unread clears `read_at` only on its newest active sibling, sets that row's
  `manual_unread_anchor` and sets conversation `manual_unread`. Marking read clears every anchor.
- New live activity creates an active sibling, clears active-sibling snoozes and resurfaces the
  conversation, but does not erase historical per-event dismissal.

These writes are bidirectional through the rollback window. Legacy reads can therefore be restored
without losing changes made through the conversation API, and conversation reads can be restored
without guessing how mixed legacy rows should fold.

MCP keeps `list_notifications` and `mark_notification_read` as event-level tools with their current
ids, exact type filter, issue and document context, timestamp fields and cursor behavior for the full
compatibility period. New `list_inbox_conversations` and `mark_inbox_conversations_read` tools expose
the grouped model and conversation cursor. The new list tool documents that its cursor is a live-feed
cursor and that a fresh first page reconciles moved conversations. Event-level tools are deprecated
only through a later versioned contract, so stored MCP cursors and automations never silently change
cardinality or id meaning.

## Realtime contract

Add `notification_conversation` to the shared sync model list. Realtime actions contain only the
conversation id, sync id, ordering, visibility and authoritative counters. They do not contain
titles, bodies, related issue data or URLs because a user-scoped catchup packet cannot re-evaluate a
team or document permission that changed after publication.

The client patches ordering and state from that non-sensitive action, then fetches only the changed
conversation summary through the authorized API. It never refetches the entire list. A dismissal or
access revocation publishes an update rather than a delete, so catchup can recover the final state.
If the summary endpoint denies current access, the client removes that conversation from view.

Team, document and workspace access removal paths lock the canonical policy root and every affected
policy child, using stable parents for absent rows, then inbox state, affected conversations and
provider deliveries in the global order. They set `access_hidden_at`, advance `access_generation`,
remove the conversations' contribution from visible counters and invalidate provider work in the same
transaction as the access change. Access-grant paths use the same lock order, recheck
canonical-subject policy and clear that state with the inverse counter transition. Both publish a
non-sensitive update after commit. Historical pull request events remain workspace-visible only when
the canonical pull request is still visible; related private Tack context is always loaded under
current policy.

The client treats both insert and update actions as upserts. An update for a conversation outside the
loaded page is inserted when visible, every upsert reorders by `(last_activity_seq, id)`, and a snoozed
or dismissed update removes the row without erasing its identity. This replaces the current behavior
that ignores unseen updates and leaves seen rows in their old position.

The client applies the row and replaces all counters with the authoritative counters included in the
mutation response or a compact counter payload published with the delta. It never infers a remote
delete or snooze from local arithmetic.

Legacy `notification` deltas continue during compatibility writes and stop after every supported
client reads conversation deltas.

## Migration and rollout

### Phase 1: Contain duplicate production

- Add `notification_source_event` with its fanout fence, nullable recipient source linkage and partial
  uniqueness for linked recipient rows.
- Add `notification.dismissed_at` and `notification.manual_unread_anchor`, replace legacy hard delete
  with a soft dismissed state, and make legacy reads exclude dismissed rows before source identities
  or provider deliveries depend on existing recipient rows.
- Persist every GitHub Slack channel delivery in the outbox before removing synchronous channel sends.
- Add delivery claim tokens and fenced completion. Drain existing processing leases and classify
  uncertain expired work as ambiguous before enabling reclaim.
- Pause webhook claims, drain every tokenless processing lease, add
  `webhook_delivery.claim_token` plus the processing-token check, deploy token-aware claims and only
  then resume. Require compare-and-swap success and failure finalization.
- Add the terminal webhook quarantine state, unresolved global scope, encrypted quarantine table,
  unique replacement replay contract and retention exception before strict GitHub identity schemas are
  enabled.
- Finalize ordinary and installation GitHub webhook deliveries in the same transaction as domain
  effects, source identities and every post-commit provider enqueue.
- Fence finalization with a claim token and require one returned delivery row before commit.
- Union linked-issue audiences before notification planning.
- Add repository-and-head activity, context and reconciliation rows plus pull-request projections, then
  make CI failure notifications current-head transition based.
- Add failure-injection tests at every transaction boundary.

This phase improves correctness before any inbox UI changes.

### Phase 2: Add and backfill conversations

- Create `notification_conversation`, `notification_inbox_state`, `notification_snooze_wake` and
  nullable conversation, source and historical-deduplication linkage columns.
- Deploy bidirectional compatibility writes for event creation plus every legacy or conversation
  read, unread, snooze and dismiss mutation before backfill so neither read model can fall behind the
  migration cursor or rollback path.
- Pause notification provider claims and drain active leases before classifying historical recipient
  or delivery duplicates. Claims remain paused until the recipient and delivery verifiers pass.
- Run `bun run notifications:conversations-backfill` as a resumable, idempotent command in bounded
  primary-key batches, never as DML inside a Drizzle migration. Persist a high-water mark and repeat
  the tail pass until no gaps remain.
- Resolve canonical pull requests through `github_pull_request`, `git_link` and repository identity.
- Use separate issue activity and status keys.
- Create one source row for each exact provider activity identity where equivalence is provable, then
  classify same-user duplicates through the survivor rule below. Give every non-equivalent legacy
  recipient row a unique `legacy-notification:<id>` source key rather than inventing source equivalence.
  Conversation grouping can still collapse those events by canonical subject.
- For each historical equivalence group, lock the source and group rows by user. Keep an existing
  source-linked row as survivor, or choose the first row by `created_at` and id when none is linked.
  Under the conversation compatibility-state version fence, fold the group's active or dismissed,
  all-active-snooze, real-unread-or-manual-anchor, inbox visibility and confirmed delivery-channel
  state into the survivor without overwriting a newer dual-write, and link only it to the shared source.
  Mark other rows as non-surfaced audit duplicates of the survivor with a null source id.
- Lock the group's provider deliveries last and group them by the new source, provider and destination
  key. Resolve every uncertain send before selection. A confirmed delivered row always wins as the
  canonical row, ordered by provider confirmation time, `created_at` and id when several exist. With no
  delivered row, choose the first currently eligible and definitively unsent pending or failed row by
  `created_at` and id; when none exists, choose the first terminal row using the fixed status priority
  `dead_letter` before `unavailable`, followed by `created_at` and id.
  Reparent that one canonical row to the survivor. A redundant confirmed send remains delivered as an
  audit duplicate; every redundant definitively unsent pending or failed row becomes unavailable with
  a legacy-duplicate reason. Audit-duplicate delivery rows keep a null source, retain provider ids and
  cannot be claimed.
- Re-read each equivalence group and set `fanout_completed_at` only when every recipient row is either
  the linked survivor or points to it, and every owned delivery is either the canonical source-linked
  row or a terminal audit duplicate of it. The resumable verifier must report zero incomplete
  historical sources, unclassified historical rows, source-less non-audit deliveries, retryable or
  ambiguous audit deliveries and canonical destination-key collisions before provider claims or
  payload pruning are enabled.
- Preserve the latest event snapshot. A conversation is unread when any retained inbox event is
  unread, which collapses duplicate badges without silently marking work read.
- Transfer Phase 1 legacy dismissal into conversation state. Enqueue generation-fenced wake rows for
  every active snooze before enabling materialized visibility counters.
- Evaluate current canonical-subject policy inside the conversation-write transaction while holding
  the full canonical-root and policy-dependency lock set used by live grant, revoke, link, membership
  and mapping mutations. Absent child rows use the same stable parent locks. Only then insert or update
  the conversation, copy the current access generation and mark inaccessible rows access-hidden before
  materialized counters or realtime conversation reads are enabled. The backfill never evaluates
  policy and writes visibility in separate transactions.
- Compare conversation and legacy unread results in structured server logs without sending product
  telemetry.
- Require `bun run notifications:conversations-verify` to report zero unlinked surfaced rows, zero
  unclassified historical rows, zero provider-classification drift and zero compatibility-state drift
  for active or dismissed, snooze, real unread, manual unread and delivery channels before read cutover.
  Backfill locks a conversation before applying state and never overwrites a newer dual-written read,
  snooze or dismissal.
- After verification, validate a check requiring every row to have exactly one of a source id or a
  historical deduplication target. Live writes always use a source id; only classified historical audit
  duplicates may use the deduplication target.
- Validate the equivalent source-or-deduplication check for provider deliveries, then resume provider
  claims with query guards that exclude every audit-duplicate notification and delivery.
- Build final unique and list indexes with a measured, low-lock release procedure. Do not make linkage
  columns non-null until backfill completeness and query plans are verified.

### Phase 3: Switch web, realtime and MCP

- Move filtering and pagination to the conversation API.
- Show the latest event in the list and the full event history in the detail pane.
- Switch realtime to conversation updates and authoritative counters.
- Complete the MCP compatibility window.

### Phase 4: Finish provider delivery

- Add Slack thread identity and provider request ids.
- Drain every Slack reconnect before activation. Rebind eligible queued work and ready thread rows
  only for same-namespace credential rotation; invalidate them for a team or app change.
- Upgrade the already durable flat Slack channel deliveries to conversation threads.
- Enable threaded channel delivery first, then direct messages.
- Enqueue notification email durably and enable its Resend worker only after retry and status tests
  pass. Do not change unrelated transactional email.
- Expose pending, retrying, unavailable and dead-letter counts in integration diagnostics.

### Phase 5: Remove compatibility paths

- In a separate contract PR, require `conversation_id`, `occurred_at`, `ingested_at` and
  `ingestion_seq`, plus a source id for every row without a historical deduplication target, only after
  every deployed writer and allowed rollback deployment populates them.
- Remove time-window deduplication and legacy row-level inbox mutations.
- Stop publishing legacy notification deltas.
- Decide event retention only after production volume is measured. Any future pruning follows the
  source-lock and dependency eligibility contract above and keeps source-key tombstones long enough to
  prevent redelivery from recreating old events.

The contract PR preflights nulls and orphaned composite references, adds `NOT VALID` checks where
appropriate, validates them separately, and only then changes nullability. It records the deployment
rollback floor and requires a current backup plus a restore rehearsal before removing compatibility
columns or paths.

Schema-dependent phases require `bun run db:release` against production before the corresponding
application merge, following the repository deployment contract.

Before touching the existing notification table, the release records row counts, duplicate source
candidates, estimated index size and representative query plans and sets bounded lock and statement
timeouts. Tack's release runner is transactional, so an index that must be built with
`CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY` is created through a separately approved, audited operation and then
adopted by an idempotent schema migration and drift check. It is never hidden inside the resumable
data backfill.

### Rollback

Every schema change is additive through the compatibility window. A global operational switch can
return web, realtime and MCP reads to the legacy rows while bidirectional compatibility writes
continue. A separate global switch pauses threaded Slack workers without deleting pending
deliveries. These switches are rollout controls, not organization entitlements.

Rollback never drops conversation, source-key, thread or outbox data. It pauses consumers, restores
the previous read path and preserves rows for diagnosis. Final non-null constraints and legacy-path
removal happen only after the rollback window has passed, so those final changes require a new forward
migration rather than a destructive down migration.

## Observability and operations

Store or log installation-local operational signals for:

- webhook claims, reclaims, terminal duplicates, quarantines and failures
- source event conflicts by producer
- snooze wake lag, stale generations and failed wake attempts
- conversation backfill progress and ambiguous legacy rows
- legacy-versus-conversation counter differences during shadow reads
- outbox queue depth, oldest pending age, attempts and dead letters
- Slack request latency, rate limits, authentication failures and ambiguous sends
- provider deliveries made unavailable by current policy, preference or destination checks
- current-head CI status transitions, head-reconciliation lag and ignored old-head events

Integration settings show actionable Slack delivery health without exposing tokens. The minimum
operator alerts are a growing oldest-pending age, any sustained webhook failure rate, any dead-letter
delivery and any non-zero shadow-read drift after backfill completion.

## Security and authorization

- Recipient planning still intersects every audience with current workspace and team membership.
- Conversation list, history and mutations require recipient ownership, organization scope and
  current canonical-subject reachability.
- Related issue and project context is loaded only after current policy checks.
- Access revocation persists `access_hidden_at`, updates materialized counters and publishes a
  non-sensitive state change for open and reconnecting clients. Restoration is an explicit inverse
  transition after policy succeeds. Both use the provider preflight lock order, and revocation marks
  every not-yet-started affected delivery unavailable in the same transaction.
- Every provider worker reloads the source event and rechecks current canonical-subject policy and
  current preferences immediately before delivery. Slack direct messages also require current
  membership and mapping, notification email requires a current verified address, and shared Slack
  channels require an enabled mapping whose workspace or team scope can see the subject.
- Webhook signatures are verified before claim or parsing behavior changes.
- Provider request and response logs never contain credentials or full sensitive payloads.

## Test strategy

### Idempotency and failure injection

- The same GitHub delivery received concurrently creates one source event total and one immutable
  recipient event per authorized recipient.
- A crash before transaction commit leaves no effects and permits safe reclaim.
- A crash after transaction commit sees a terminal delivery and creates no duplicate.
- A stale webhook claimant cannot finalize or commit domain effects after another claimant receives
  a fresh token.
- A tokenless old handler cannot finalize while or after a token-aware claimant reclaims the same
  webhook delivery.
- A quarantined delivery survives ordinary webhook retention, then replays exactly once under a fenced
  claim after a parser fix. Ordinary pruning after replay clears eligible sensitive payloads but cannot
  delete its parent delivery identity, reason or replay audit tombstones.
- Missing or malformed organization and installation routing still creates one globally scoped
  quarantine row without inventing tenant attribution; a later fenced resolution can bind it safely.
- Replay crashes immediately before and after replacement scheduling commit, and before and after the
  replacement effects commit, always reuse the one `replay_of_delivery_id` row and create domain,
  source, inbox and provider effects at most once.
- Organization deletion is not blocked by quarantine retention. It clears encrypted tenant content,
  disables replay and retains only the bounded non-sensitive global audit tombstone.
- Redelivery after the old 60 second window still creates no duplicate.
- Fanout completion and pruning share the source lock. Pruning cannot observe or pass an incomplete
  fanout transaction, and a completed fanout fence rejects every later ordinary enqueue whether or not
  payload pruning has run. Pending, retryable and ambiguous deliveries block pruning. Once every
  dependency is terminal or reconciled, pruning retains the source-key tombstone and a redelivery still
  creates no duplicate.
- Historical source backfill can crash and resume between sibling batches but closes fanout only after
  a locked recheck proves every row is either the existing or deterministically selected
  source-and-user survivor or a non-surfaced audit duplicate of that survivor.
- A same-source, same-user group with mixed legacy dismissal, snooze, real unread, manual unread,
  inbox visibility and delivery-channel state produces one survivor with the compatibility fold's
  result and no state drift.
- Recipient and delivery deduplication constraints reject self-links, cross-user or cross-organization
  targets, chains and cycles at commit, including an attempt to demote a canonical row that already has
  inbound audit links.
- A legacy duplicate with pending, failed, processing, ambiguous and confirmed delivery variants
  selects the confirmed delivery as canonical regardless of row age and resumes with no retryable audit
  duplicate, uniqueness collision or provider resend. With no confirmed delivery, at most one
  definitively unsent eligible row remains retryable. Unresolved provider uncertainty blocks worker
  restart.
- A direct check-run or commit-status mutation accepted between a full head fetch and snapshot binding
  advances the head context generation, rejects the stale replacement and rearms reconciliation.
- A status or check-run received before its pull request is mirrored remains durable in the
  repository-and-head activity and context tables and binds when the pull request appears.
- One pull request linked to several issues creates one recipient event and retains every authorized
  related issue as context.
- Live ingestion racing a grant or revocation shares the canonical policy lock. A grant that commits
  first is included when the audience is re-resolved. A revocation that commits first retains the
  source tombstone but creates no recipient event, conversation, delivery or counter contribution.
  If ingestion linearizes first, a later revocation hides its conversation and invalidates unstarted
  deliveries atomically, while a later grant does not retroactively fan out the event.
- Linked-issue ACL, team membership and shared-channel mapping grant or revoke races use their stable
  policy roots and child order and produce the same commit-time authorization result.
- Two deliveries with reversed overlapping audiences complete without deadlock because they acquire
  policy dependencies, notification sources, recipient state and conversations in the same global
  and within-class order.
- A legacy event mutation racing a conversation mutation completes without deadlock because both
  acquire inbox state, conversation and sibling events in the same order.

### Conversation state

- Comment, review, inline comment, check failure and merge events for one pull request share one
  conversation.
- Issue activity and issue status use separate conversations.
- Read-before-event and event-before-read races produce the specified result.
- Manual unread on activity increments total and activity counters; on status it increments only
  total. Neither path invents an unread mention or event.
- A conversation manual-unread round trip through the legacy API preserves its anchor, keeps unread
  event count at zero and clears the anchor on mark-read or real new activity. A legacy event-level
  unread still counts as one unread event.
- New live activity clears snooze and dismissal; backfill does not.
- A due snooze wakes after worker restart, updates visible counters once, and publishes a recoverable
  delta. Expiry racing with read, resnooze, dismissal or new activity respects the latest snooze
  generation and state.
- Ambiguous legacy rows are not merged.
- Unread and mention badges count conversations.

### GitHub CI

- Old-head failure after a force push does not change current status or notify.
- Several failed jobs on one head create one failure-transition notification.
- Job A failure, job B failure and job A success leaves the aggregate failed while the coarser
  current-head source identity emits only one failure notification.
- Check suite, workflow run and check run overlap does not duplicate a failure.
- A check-suite or workflow-run event with no constituent run available creates a durable head job;
  an empty first fetch retries with bounded backoff, and a later fenced reconciliation fills contexts
  without creating a competing aggregate source.
- A repository-and-head trigger with no mirrored pull request retains its snapshot and binds when the
  pull request appears. New triggers rearm completed jobs and invalidate processing claims by advancing
  the version and requiring a rerun.
- Snapshot acceptance and existing-PR binding are atomic under the head lock. For a no-PR snapshot, a
  newer suite or workflow trigger that commits before PR mirroring advances the job version and blocks
  the older snapshot from binding or emitting a failure.
- Two pull requests sharing one repository and head use the same head context but independent
  projections and PR-specific notification source ids.
- A full-head fetch invalidated by a direct event, newer trigger or lost claim retains a distinct fetch
  attempt and every normalized raw activity with an invalidated disposition while changing no context
  or projection.
- A crash after the provider request but before result persistence leaves its precommitted `started`
  attempt for the reclaimer to mark abandoned; the next request uses a new attempt id.
- An old fetch worker and a reclaimer racing attempt finalization both lock head before attempt and
  finish without deadlock or resurrection of the lost claim.
- Check-run reruns from one app and name update one context; equal names from different apps remain
  separate; different names from one app remain separate; separator-like and case-variant check names
  remain exact and collision-free; case variants and creator rotations update one commit-status
  context; check-run and commit-status sources remain distinct without an explicit adapter.
- Renaming one check run from a failed name to a successful name cannot leave the old context active.
  The aggregate waits for fenced full-head reconciliation, which supersedes provider-absent keys.
- A table-driven normalizer maps check run, check suite and workflow run `head_sha` plus top-level
  status `sha` into the same checked-commit field. Missing or malformed identity quarantines the
  provider delivery without source, activity, inbox or outbox effects.
- Failure, success and failure on one head notify once; a new failing head can notify once again.
- Out-of-order events cannot regress pull request state.
- A stale synchronize event cannot move the head SHA backward, and a check received before its head
  becomes current participates when that head epoch is accepted.
- Equal-time conflicting pull request SHAs remain unresolved until the pull-request job reloads the
  authoritative PR, advances the epoch and schedules checks for the selected head.
- Equal provider update times with conflicting states trigger reconciliation and cannot produce an
  aggregate transition until authoritative state is fetched.
- Raw pending, success and repeated failure activities retain delivery or reconciliation provenance
  even when they create no new coarse notification source.

### API, realtime and MCP

- Every tab paginates matching conversations on the server.
- Soft dismissal is restored correctly through realtime catchup.
- Counters remain correct across two tabs and concurrent read or snooze actions.
- Older mutation responses and realtime counter snapshots cannot replace a newer counter version.
- Legacy MCP tools preserve event ids, exact type filters and cursors while the new tools expose
  conversations.
- Current membership and team-policy changes immediately affect related context visibility.
- An open inbox and a reconnecting inbox both evict or redact a conversation after access loss.
- Access hide and restore update materialized counters and versions exactly once without exposing a
  hidden conversation through badge drift.
- Conversation backfill racing an access grant, revoke, link or membership change shares the full
  policy dependency lock set and cannot create a row with stale `access_hidden_at`,
  `access_generation` or counters.

### Slack

- Concurrent workers create one root message for one destination and conversation.
- Later events use the persisted root `thread_ts`.
- Two workers racing distinct source events for one ready thread lock the thread before either
  delivery, so only the lower ingestion sequence becomes processing; the second remains unclaimed
  until the first reaches a nonblocking terminal state.
- A channel configured through several linked issues receives one delivery.
- An enabled shared-channel mapping produces one channel delivery regardless of legacy per-user
  `slack` preference rows, while a disabled `slack_dm` preference still prevents that user's direct
  message.
- Provider success followed by process failure before persisting `channel` and `ts` becomes ambiguous,
  performs no second `chat.postMessage` and blocks replies until reconciliation.
- Slack request-contract coverage rejects `client_msg_id` and distinguishes a confirmed structured
  rejection from an unknown transport outcome.
- An expired processing lease without provider proof becomes ambiguous, and a stale delivery claimant
  cannot finalize after lease loss.
- An ambiguous reply blocks every higher ingestion sequence for its destination and conversation
  until reconciliation, so a later reply cannot overtake it.
- Rate limits retry, permanent errors stop, authentication errors request reconnection and exhausted
  deliveries become visible dead letters.
- Removing a member before a queued direct message is claimed prevents delivery.
- Revoking canonical-subject access before a queued direct message, email or shared-channel claim
  prevents provider contact even when organization membership remains.
- Provider preflight and access revocation races follow their shared linearization lock: revocation
  first prevents contact, while a recorded send start is treated as already in flight and fences all
  later work.
- A Slack team change makes old queued destinations and thread roots unavailable.
- A team or app reconnect drains an already claimed send before activating the new namespace, so no
  worker can start a post against the old workspace after activation.
- Same-team credential rotation drains active leases, then rebinds a pending root and pending reply
  to the new generation without losing the existing ready thread.
- Existing delivery statuses and expired leases migrate to the specified terminal or retry states.
- Notification email resolves the current verified address and preference at send time, uses the
  delivery idempotency key, and remains pending until the Resend worker confirms a provider id.
- Email retries reuse the immutable first-attempt payload, stop when its address is no longer current,
  and become ambiguous before the provider's idempotency retention expires.

### Full verification

- Focused package tests for every phase.
- Database migration and schema-equivalence checks.
- `bun run verify` with a dedicated test lane.
- Playwright coverage for grouping, history, tabs, keyboard actions and counter updates.
- Production smoke checks for GitHub webhook health, inbox pagination and Slack delivery diagnostics.

## Trade-offs

### Conversation summary plus immutable events

This duplicates the latest event fields, but makes inbox reads and server-side tab pagination fast
without losing history. Recomputing every row from event history would be simpler to write and more
expensive and fragile to operate.

### Canonical pull request subject

This fixes duplicate PR conversations and gives Slack one thread. It means a PR linked to several
issues has one list row, so the detail view must present the related issues clearly instead of using
one issue as the row identity.

### Fixed issue activity and status families

This retains the useful Activity and Status separation. A single Tack issue can have two
conversations, which is intentional and bounded.

### Phased compatibility-write rollout

This requires compatibility code and temporary shadow comparisons. It avoids a high-risk cutover of
schema, UI, realtime, MCP, GitHub and Slack behavior in one deployment.

### Durable provider outbox

Delivery becomes eventually consistent instead of occurring in the webhook request. In return,
provider failures are visible, retryable and cannot decide whether a GitHub delivery is processed.

## Decisions requested before implementation

The recommended defaults are:

1. Unread badges count conversations, not individual events.
2. New live activity clears snooze and dismissal so the conversation resurfaces.
3. Pull requests use one conversation even when linked to several Tack issues.
4. Issue activity and issue status remain separate conversations.
5. Slack uses one root plus non-broadcast replies per destination and conversation.
6. Existing resolvable rows are collapsed during backfill, while ambiguous rows remain separate.
7. Delivery and ingestion containment ships before the visible inbox cutover.
8. Workspace and team admins control shared Slack channel delivery through channel mappings;
   individual users control only their Slack direct messages.

## What to revisit as Tack grows

- Split event storage from recipient state if recipient fanout makes per-user event rows too large.
- Partition old event history only after measured volume justifies the operational complexity.
- Add digest summaries for high-volume conversations without changing source idempotency.
- Move webhook processing to a dedicated queue only if the transactional path cannot consistently
  answer GitHub inside its delivery timeout.
- Add user-controlled conversation grouping only if the fixed subject model proves insufficient.
