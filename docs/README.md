# Tack documentation

Tack is a free, realtime, keyboard-first task manager. Issues, boards, sprints,
projects and docs, all of which update the moment anyone changes anything.

There is no pricing, no billing and no paid tier, so nothing in these docs is
gated behind a plan.

## The five minute version

The canonical quick start is in [Getting started](getting-started.md). Follow
that page for the full commands and troubleshooting notes.
## What Tack is

- **Issues** with priorities, labels, states, estimates, assignees, multiple
  reviewers and relations, as a fast list or a drag-and-drop board.
- **Sprints and cycles** for timeboxed planning, with scope, points and burndown.
- **Projects and milestones** that group work across teams, with a workspace
  feed of project health updates.
- **Docs** with a rich editor, living next to the issues they describe.
- **Standup** as a Kanban of the whole workspace, filtered to work a person
  owns or reviews with a click.
- **Analytics**: scope, throughput, churn and distribution by assignee, project,
  label and estimate.
- **Search, filters and saved views**, shared with the team or kept private.
- **Realtime everywhere.** A change writes to Postgres, publishes to Redis, and
  fans out over a websocket to everyone allowed to see it.
- **An MCP server**, so an agent can read the board and file work with the same
  permissions the person who authorised it has.
- **Notifications**, an inbox and GitHub integration.

## What Tack is not

It has no pricing, no seats and no usage limits, and it never will. It does not
phone home. It does not try to be a CRM, a helpdesk or a spreadsheet. When there
are two reasonable ways to do something, Tack picks one and fixes that one.
