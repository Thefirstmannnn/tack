# Configuration

Every setting is an environment variable. `.env.example` is a working local
configuration, so copy it and change what you need:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

> **Self-hosting status: Preview.** The production values on this page are a
> configuration reference, not a supported production release or provider
> compatibility guarantee. See [Open-source readiness](open-source-readiness.md).

Tack parses its own environment with Zod at startup, so a missing or malformed
required variable fails immediately with a message that names it, rather than
failing later somewhere confusing.

Bun does not implement `process.loadEnvFile`, so scripts load the repository
`.env` with `bun --env-file=../../.env` in the script itself. A script whose
working directory is inside a workspace package will not see the repository
`.env` without that flag.

## Required

| Variable | Example | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `DATABASE_URL` | `postgres://tack:tack@localhost:5434/tack` | Postgres 16 or newer. In production use the runtime connection string recommended by your provider |
| `REDIS_URL` | `redis://localhost:6380` | Redis 7 or newer. Carries realtime fan-out. Use `rediss://` for TLS |
| `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` | 32+ random characters | Signs sessions. `openssl rand -base64 32`. Never reuse the example value |
| `BETTER_AUTH_URL` | `https://tack.example.com` | Must match the origin exactly, or sign-in loops |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` | `https://tack.example.com` | Public origin. Used for absolute links in email and OAuth metadata |

## Database

| Variable | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `DATABASE_PREPARED_STATEMENTS` | `false` | Set to `true` only when the database endpoint supports protocol-level named prepared statements |

Tack disables automatic named prepared statements by default because transaction
poolers do not expose that capability consistently. Direct connections and session
poolers support them. Some transaction poolers support them when configured to track
named statements, while others require them to stay off.

Do not add a `prepare` query option to `DATABASE_URL`. Tack refuses that ambiguous
configuration and uses `DATABASE_PREPARED_STATEMENTS` as the single source of truth.
Connection options such as `sslmode=require` remain in `DATABASE_URL`.

## Scheduled maintenance

| Variable | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| `CRON_SECRET` | Protects the scheduled sprint rollover, sprint snapshot, operational pruning, and notification worker routes. Use a long random value in every deployed environment |
| `NOTIFICATION_PROVIDERS_PAUSED` | Set `true` to stop Slack and notification-email claims during migration or incident response. Defaults to false |
| `NOTIFICATION_CONVERSATIONS_ENABLED` | Set `true` after conversation backfill and verification to select the grouped inbox. False or unset retains the legacy view |

Vercel presents `CRON_SECRET` as a bearer token when it invokes the scheduled
routes. Without the secret, protected routes refuse to run. The notification
worker runs every minute. Slack delivery additionally requires
`SLACK_ENABLED=true`; notification email requires Resend configuration.
Pausing providers preserves queued work and still allows GitHub reconciliation
and snooze wakes. See [Inbox conversations](features/inbox.md) for rollout order.
The sprint rollover route runs every minute. It closes expired sprints and moves
unfinished committed tasks into the next scheduled sprint, creating a successor
with the same duration if needed. Completed and canceled tasks retain their sprint;
triage and backlog tasks return to the backlog, matching manual completion.
Missed boundaries are processed oldest first, up to 100 completions per invocation.
Repeated or overlapping invocations do not close a sprint twice. Task assignment
menus and filters show current and future sprints, with the active one labeled
Current sprint. The Current sprint filter stores a relative selection, so saved
views follow the active sprint when the calendar advances. Open pages refresh
sprint choices, facet counts, and relative sprint results within a minute, and
refresh stale workspace data when the window regains focus. Sprint history
remains available from the Sprints page.

New workspaces and newly created sprints default to seven days. Explicit dates
remain supported, and existing sprint dates are not rewritten. A workspace that
already has two-week sprints keeps that schedule until its dates are edited.
To change an existing schedule, edit the sprint dates from the Sprints page and
use **Move later sprints by the same amount** when later windows must move too.
The rollover job uses stored dates, not the sprint number or a calendar-week
number.

If a menu shows Current sprint (Sprint 1) but omits Sprint 2, inspect the stored
windows and completion state on the Sprints page or the authenticated
`/api/cycles` response. Current means `startsAt <= now < endsAt` and not completed;
expired or completed sprints are excluded from assignment menus, and archived
records are excluded from workspace data. A missing number alone does not prove
that rollover failed. Check the Vercel cron invocation logs for
`/api/cron/sprint-rollover` to verify execution. An unauthenticated 401 confirms
route protection, not a successful scheduled run. Correct the dates or completion
state only after establishing why that specific sprint was excluded.
The analytics route runs every six hours so every sprint-local
calendar day is observed across timezone and daylight-saving changes. It records
one row per active sprint and local day, then publishes the returned realtime
actions. Sprint completion also records a final snapshot in the same transaction
before unfinished work rolls into the next sprint. New and updated sprint timezones
must be valid IANA names. A legacy sprint with an invalid stored timezone uses UTC
explicitly so it cannot block other snapshots or prevent the sprint from closing.

## Realtime

| Variable | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_REALTIME_URL` | unset | **Local development only.** Set it to `ws://localhost:3100` locally; the app connects to `/api/ws` under it |
| `REALTIME_PORT` | `3100` | Port for `apps/realtime`, which is never deployed |

`NEXT_PUBLIC_REALTIME_URL` is ignored whenever `NODE_ENV` is `production`, where
the socket is always served from the page's own origin at `/api/ws`. Setting it
on a deployed environment does nothing useful and risks confusing whoever reads
the config next, so leave it unset there.

## Authentication

Tack uses [better-auth](https://better-auth.com). A production build and server
start require at least one usable first-login method: password authentication,
a complete Google or GitHub credential pair, or email OTP delivery through
Resend with an explicit non-local sender. Passkeys work after a user registers
one, but cannot bootstrap a new installation. Local development is unaffected.

| Variable | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` | Google sign-in. Redirect URI is `<app>/api/auth/callback/google` |
| `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID`, `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET` | GitHub sign-in. Callback is `<app>/api/auth/callback/github` |
| `TACK_PASSWORD_AUTH` | `false` by default. `true` enables email and password |
| `ALLOWED_EMAIL_DOMAINS` | Unset by default, which means anyone can sign up. Comma separated to restrict |
| `TACK_DEV_LOGIN` | **Local only.** One-click sign-in as any seeded user |

Email and password is off by default and hashed with `@node-rs/argon2`
(argon2id) when on. It is rate limited, and it is never a replacement for the
passwordless methods. Leave it off unless you have a reason.

Signing up is open unless you close it. A new account creates its own workspace
through the onboarding flow, and a workspace admits nobody else until it invites
them, so an open instance is still one tenant per workspace.

`ALLOWED_EMAIL_DOMAINS` closes that door. It is enforced on invite creation, on
user creation and when a sign-in code is requested, so it covers every provider
rather than just invites, and it is checked again on every session so an address
that stops qualifying loses access. A refused address is told so, rather than
being left waiting for a code that will never arrive.

Set it when an instance should only admit one organisation. A value that is set
but names no domain, such as a bare `@`, is refused rather than read as no
restriction, so a typo cannot quietly open an instance you meant to close.

A workspace can narrow it further with its own `allowedEmailDomains` setting. The
hosted instance at <https://YOUR_DOMAIN> leaves it unset.

Authentication is rate limited per IP whatever the method: 10 sign-in code requests
each ten minutes, 5 password sign-ins a minute, and 5 password sign-ups an hour,
on top of better-auth's own defaults for the paths without a rule of their own.
Better-auth applies them in production only, and a sign-in code additionally dies
after three wrong guesses.

A custom rule replaces better-auth's matching default rather than stacking with
it, which is why the sign-in code window is ten minutes and not an hour. An
hourly rule would have to allow a whole hour of sends in a single burst, and a
per-IP hourly cap tight enough to be worth having would lock out an office that
shares one address.

In production those counters live in Redis, on the `REDIS_URL` the app already
needs, so the caps hold across every serverless instance rather than resetting
with each one. If Redis cannot be reached the check lets the request through
rather than locking everybody out, which means an outage costs you the ceiling
and not sign-in. Outside production better-auth keeps its own in-process store,
which is all a single development server needs.

```bash
ALLOWED_EMAIL_DOMAINS=example.com,example.org
```

**`TACK_DEV_LOGIN` must never be set on a deployed environment.** It lists the
seeded users on the login screen and signs anyone in as any of them.

`TACK_DEV_LOGIN` and passkeys do not satisfy the production first-login check.
Half-configured OAuth providers, blank values and the local
`Tack <auth@tack.local>` sender are also rejected.

This check proves only that a complete method is present. It cannot contact an
OAuth provider or confirm that Resend has verified the sender domain, so test a
real production sign-in after deployment.

## Email

Tack sends through [Resend](https://resend.com) only, for sign-in codes and
invites. Event notification email and digests are not currently dispatched.

| Variable | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| `RESEND_API_KEY` | From the Resend dashboard |
| `EMAIL_FROM` | Must be on a domain verified in Resend |

```bash
RESEND_API_KEY=re_xxxxxxxxx
EMAIL_FROM="Tack <tack@example.com>"
```

If `EMAIL_FROM` is not on a verified domain every send fails, and users see
missing sign-in codes and invitations.

The sender in `.env.example` is local-only. Replace it before relying on Resend
for production authentication.

## Object storage

Any S3-compatible bucket. Uploads go straight from the browser through a
presigned PUT.

| Variable | Local value | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `S3_ENDPOINT` | `http://localhost:9010` | MinIO locally, R2 or S3 in production |
| `S3_REGION` | `us-east-1` | `auto` for Cloudflare R2 |
| `S3_BUCKET` | `tack-uploads` | |
| `S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID` | `tackminio` | |
| `S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | `tackminio` | |

The bucket needs a CORS policy allowing your origin, otherwise uploads fail in
the browser while the server logs look healthy. `infra/s3-cors.json` is the
document, with the origin as a placeholder.

Workspace deletion needs permission to list and delete both current objects and
object versions. On AWS S3, grant `s3:ListBucket`, `s3:ListBucketVersions`,
`s3:DeleteObject`, and `s3:DeleteObjectVersion` for the upload bucket.

## Integrations

| Variable | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| `GITHUB_APP_ID` | GitHub App, for linking pull requests to issues |
| `GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY` | The PEM. Escaped newlines as `\n` are handled |
| `GITHUB_APP_SLUG` | The app's URL slug. Without it, the connect button hides |
| `GITHUB_APP_CLIENT_ID`, `GITHUB_APP_CLIENT_SECRET` | Exchange the callback code to confirm the installation belongs to the person connecting. Without them the connect flow refuses rather than binding an installation it cannot attribute |
| `GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | Verifies inbound webhooks |
| `SLACK_CLIENT_ID` | Slack OAuth client ID. It is not secret |
| `SLACK_APP_ID` | Optional fallback app identity for legacy connections. New OAuth connections store the returned app ID automatically |
| `SLACK_CLIENT_SECRET` | Slack OAuth client secret. Mark it Sensitive in Vercel |
| `SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET` | Verifies Slack webhook signatures. Mark it Sensitive in Vercel |
| `SLACK_ENABLED` | Global server-side Slack gate. `true` enables Slack for every current and future Tack organization. False or unset keeps Slack dark |

All are optional. Tack hides the GitHub affordance when it is not configured.
Slack requires all three Slack OAuth and webhook variables. Keep
`SLACK_ENABLED=false` or leave it unset while preparing a deployment. Setting
it to `true` is a global release action: the Slack settings surface, routes,
webhook processing, and notification worker become available to every current
and future Tack organization. It does not connect an organization
automatically. An authorized manager must complete a separate OAuth connection
for each organization.

Do not configure `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` or `SLACK_APP_TOKEN`.
Tack does not use those global tokens. Prefer reconnecting legacy installations
through OAuth to persist their app identity. See [Integrations](integrations.md#slack) for the safe
launch sequence and Slack-side configuration.

## MCP

| Variable | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_MCP_URL` | Overrides the advertised MCP URL. Defaults to `<app>/mcp` |

You almost never need this. It exists for deployments that put the MCP endpoint
behind a different hostname. See [MCP server](mcp.md).

## Testing

| Variable | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| `TACK_TEST_LANE` | Isolates a test run into its own set of databases |
| `TACK_E2E_BASE_URL` | Where Playwright points. Defaults to `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` |

`TACK_TEST_LANE` matters whenever two runs share a Postgres, which happens with
two worktrees or two agents. Without it both runs truncate the same tables and
you get deadlocks and foreign key violations that look like real failures.

```bash
TACK_TEST_LANE=my-branch bun run test
TACK_TEST_LANE=my-branch bun run db:test-lanes-drop
```

The lane name becomes a readable stub plus a digest of the raw value, so two
lanes that normalise alike stay apart.

The cleanup drops only the lane named by `TACK_TEST_LANE`, and refuses when
that is unset. `bun run db:test-lanes-drop --all` drops every lane on the
server, including lanes another worktree is using. Neither mode touches the six
base databases.

## Reference: a deployment environment

```bash
DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:pass@runtime-db.example.com:5432/tack?sslmode=require
DATABASE_PREPARED_STATEMENTS=false
REDIS_URL=rediss://default:pass@redis.example.com:6379
CRON_SECRET=<openssl rand -base64 32>

BETTER_AUTH_SECRET=<openssl rand -base64 32>
BETTER_AUTH_URL=https://tack.example.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://tack.example.com

GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=...
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=...

ALLOWED_EMAIL_DOMAINS=example.com

RESEND_API_KEY=re_...
EMAIL_FROM="Tack <tack@example.com>"

S3_ENDPOINT=https://<account>.r2.cloudflarestorage.com
S3_REGION=auto
S3_BUCKET=tack-uploads
S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID=...
S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=...
```

Note what is absent: no `NEXT_PUBLIC_REALTIME_URL`, and no `TACK_DEV_LOGIN`.

`ALLOWED_EMAIL_DOMAINS` appears here because this example is a single-company
deployment. Drop the line to let anyone sign up, which is what the hosted
instance does.
